%% 


%% File Data, also known as PDF Metadata, is non-printing identifying
%%   information in the PDF file. Some or all of it can be read by various
%%   PDF reader software.
%% PDF/X is also considered File Data, as it concerns the structure of the
%%   file and its relationaship to printers, rather than its visible content.
%% In principle, you could set the title as empty. But in that case, no other
%%   File Data will be included, and you cannot have PDF/X compliance.
%% There are many more kinds of File Data that a PDF can include, such as
%%   subject and keywords. But `novel' is specifically for printing to paper,
%%   not for electronic documents that would be found by database search.
%%   Thus, there is no provision for such additional File Data.
%% When you sign up with a print service, you will provide subject, keywords,
%%   and description directly to their database, rather than in the PDF.
%% No need to set copyright in metadata, since your file is only for use by
%%   the print service, and is not being distributed as a PDF e-book.
%%   Your copyright notice is on the printed page, where it should be.
%% Particularly note that your print service is NOT the publisher: YOU are!

% Changing this does not change the software, it just changes the information.
% Normally leave as default, but can change if urgent.
