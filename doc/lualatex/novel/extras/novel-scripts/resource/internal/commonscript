# commonscript
# This file has common functions for novel-script Linux scripts.
# It is read by another script, using the source command. Do not use directly.
# $HELPMSG and $USAGEMSG are messages set by calling script.
# $TARGRES is the target resolution. 600 for b/w, 300 for other.
# Over or under TARGRES generates an Alert or a Warning, depending on how much.
# $MINRES is low-resolution warning point, 300 for b/w, 150 for other.
# $MAXRES is the excess-resolution warning point, 1200 for b/w, 600 for other.
# $1 and $2 are arguments passed from calling script.
