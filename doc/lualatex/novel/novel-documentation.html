<h2 id="h1">1. Overview</h2>
<div class="d2" id="d1">

<h3 id="h1.1">1.1. Description</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d1.1">
<p class="noindent">If you are ready to typeset your great detective novel, or your collection of sci-fi short stories, then <i>novel</i> is for you. And, if you are unfamiliar with the terminology of commercial book publishing, have no fear! This documentation is here to help you.</p>

<h4 id="h1.1.1">1.1.1. Installation</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.1.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Requires TeXLive 2016 or later (including current MikTeX).</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Some Linux (such as Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial) contains TeXLive 2015 or earlier (too old). <span style="white-space:nowrap">Work-around:</span> Remove the old TeXLive, and install newer version to your home directory, from <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">tug.org</a>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> To use <i>novel</i>, you must also install the <i>libertinus</i> package. This is not automatic.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Once you have TeX installed and running, then install <i>novel</i> and <i>libertinus</i> via your TeX package manager. On MiKTeX, they will be listed among available packages. On other TeXLive, try this command (use <code>sudo</code> if TeXLive is installed to system, instead of home directory):</p>
<p class="code"><code>tlmgr install novel libertinus</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> Test your installation: In this documentation folder, there is an <i>extras</i> subfolder. Inside is file <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>novel-example.tex</i></span>. Copy this file to your home directory, or other location with read/write privileges. You may open it in the TeXWorks editor (if installed), and compile from there. The editor will automatically detect the compiler (LuaLaTeX) and encoding <span style="white-space:nowrap">(utf-8)</span>. Or, from command line:</p>
<p class="code"><code>lualatex novel-example.tex</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> If <i>novel-example.tex</i> does not compile, the problem is (almost certainly) with your installation. Note that TeX editor software, other than TeXWorks, may or may not recognize the <i>lualatex</i> and <i>utf-8</i> directives.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> When it compiles: Inspect the PDF for fonts. It must contain <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>Libertinus Serif</i></span> and <i>NovelDeco</i> fonts, but not contain <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>Computer Modern</i></span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>Latin Modern</i></span> fonts.</p>
<p>If the fonts are incorrect: Did you install <i>libertinus</i>? Did you update the file name database? In some cases, you must clear the contents of any existing <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>luatex-cache</i></span> folder.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>G.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro software (not the free Adobe Reader): Pre-flight the PDF as <span style="white-space:nowrap">PDF/X-1a:2001</span>. It should pass without problem. Be sure that this is the standard you test (not any other PDF/X).</p>

<h3 id="h1.2">1.2. Important Behavior</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d1.2">
<p class="noindent">There are several ways that <i>novel</i> is very different from other TeX document classes. Before you wonder why your document doesn't work, you need to understand the differences. All of these are features, not bugs. They are done with the intent of making <i>novel</i> best for its intended purpose.</p>
<p>At the top of your *.tex main document, place these lines:</p>
<p class="code"><code>% !TeX TS-program = LuaLaTeX</code><br/>
<code>% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</code></p>
<p>Those instructions are read and understood by many TeX editors, and also serve as a reminder to yourself. However, they do nothing when the document is processed by command line.</p>

<h4 id="h1.2.1">1.2.1. Always Use UTF-8</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> You must create your document in <span style="white-space:nowrap">utf-8</span> encoding. No OT1, no T1, no LY1, or other TeX font encoding that pre-dates cell phones. Do not call for <i>fontenc</i> in your Preamble, because <span style="white-space:nowrap">utf-8</span> is <span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-configured</span>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you use a plain text editor, or TeXWorks, or export plain text from a word processor, be sure that your text is encoded as <span style="white-space:nowrap">utf-8</span>, <i>without</i> byte order mark (BOM).</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Instead of typing TeX codes such as <code>\`{e}</code> you can simply paste <code>è</code> from a Unicode character map. Other alphabets such as Greek and Cyrillic are directly supported, as long as you choose fonts that support those character sets.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> If you are on Windows, <i>do not</i> use Notepad! The free <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> (also <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable">Portable</a> version) is a suitable plain text editor. Configure it as specified, with utf-8 but without BOM. Does not matter whether UNIX or DOS line endings, as long as you are consistent.</p>

<h5 id="h1.2.1.1">1.2.1.1. Polyglossia Language Support</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d1.2.1.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The pre-loaded <i>polyglossia</i> package (not <i>babel</i>) provides language support. By default, <i>novel</i> is configured for American English.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If your document's language is something else, or if you will be writing in multiple languages, see the <i>polyglossia</i> package documentation regarding <code>\setdefaultlanguage</code> and other commands.</p>
</div><!-- end 1.2.1.1 -->
</div><!-- end 1.2.1 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.2">1.2.2. Do Not Load Fonts via <code>\usepackage</code> or <code>\RequirePackage</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.2">
<p class="item">The method for loading fonts is described in <a href="#h4.2">section 4.2</a>. Be sure you read that! For example, you cannot load a font with <code>\usepackage{<em>fontname</em>}</code> in this document class.</p>
</div><!-- end 1.2.2 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.3">1.2.3. Use LuaLaTeX and Open Type fonts</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.3">
<p class="item"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/doordie.png" width="279" height="300" alt="Thou Shalt"/><b>A.</b> <i>Novel</i>, uses only the <i>LuaLaTeX</i> compiler. No other! You do not need to understand <i>Lua</i> code.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The built-in <i>fontspec</i> package requires utf-8 encoding. It is able to load Open Type fonts, and access their internal feature sets. Forget Type 1 fonts and special encodings! If you wish to use Greek or Cyrillic, all you need are compatible fonts.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If you accept the pre-configured fonts (from <i>libertinus</i>), then you do not need to know anything about <i>fontspec</i>. But if you wish to configure your own fonts, <a href="#hE">Appendix E</a> reviews the most important parts of <i>fontspec</i> syntax.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end 1.2.3 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.4">1.2.4. Disabled standard text size commands</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Standard text size commands, such as <code>\small</code> or <code>\LARGE</code>, will be ignored. The text will appear at its normal size, just as if the commands did not exist.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> <i>Novel</i> provides its own capability to size text, using <a href="#h6.1">different commands</a>.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>C.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> The <i>novel</i>-specific size commands maintain text line grid, where possible. This is important for printed fiction.</p>
</div><!-- end 1.2.4 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.5">1.2.5. Disabled academic-purpose commands</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.5">
<p class="item"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/fpaper.png" width="134" height="215" alt="flunked math"/><b>A.</b> Commands such as <code>\section</code>, <code>\chapter</code>, <code>\abstract</code>, <code>\index</code>, <code>\tableofcontents</code>, <code>\maketitle</code>, and many other structural commands will not work with <i>novel</i>. This is intentional.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The <i>float</i> and <i>table</i> environments are ineffective. This is intentional. In <i>novel</i> there are specific ways to <a href="#h7.3">place images</a> or construct a <a href="#h8.3.2.7">table of contents</a>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> <i>Novel</i> has <a href="#h5">chapter-related commands</a> specifically created for the needs of fictional works.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> <i>Novel</i> is focused on doing one thing well, rather than many things poorly. That is why so many "academic" commands have been discarded. They are not necessary in popular fiction.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end 1.2.5 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.6">1.2.6. Images must be raster png or jpg</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.6">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> You may use raster images in <i>png</i> or <i>jpg</i> format.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Images must be processed to <a href="#h7">specifications</a>, and placed using <a href="#h7.3">special commands</a>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Do not use vector formats such as <i>eps</i>, <i>svg</i>, or <i>pdf</i>.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Why only raster images? Since <i>novel</i> is for printed books, there is no advantage to scalable vector artwork. However, there is a disadvantage: Vector artwork often has technical errors that you cannot detect, but a commercial printer can detect.</p>
</div><!-- end 1.2.6 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.7">1.2.7. Beware of $, %, and Other TeX Special Characters</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.7">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> This is standard TeX behavior. Just a reminder!</p>
<p class="item"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/trdol.png" width="238" height="67" alt="dollar is math mode"/><b>B.</b> TeX has a number of special characters. If you type them in a document, they will not appear as an ordinary printed character, but will do something else. These are:</p>
<p class="code"><code>$ % # _ ^ & ~ \ { }</code> and sometimes <code>[ ]</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> In some cases, an incorrect usage will provide an error message that can be easily deciphered.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Incorrect use of the dollar sign may either place your text in math mode (not your intent) or produce a baffling error message that points to an innocent package.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> The percent symbol normally produces no error, since it is a comment character. But then, whatever text follows on that line will be missing from your PDF. Unless you carefully review the PDF, you might not notice that text is missing.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> Special characters, other than the backslash, are escaped by placing a backslash in front, thus: <code>\$</code> for the dollar sign, <code>\%</code> for percent. If you must print a backslash, <code>\string\</code> does it.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>G.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> To avoid unforeseen problems, you should review your document in a text editor, prior to compiling. Search for any instances of special characters, particularly dollar and percent. Backslash them as needed.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end 1.2.7 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.8">1.2.8. Avoid TeX Editors and IDEs</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.8">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Many TeX editors assume that you are using a standard TeX document class. They may attempt to insert code that does not work in <i>novel</i> class. Or, they may not understand the commands specific to <i>novel</i>. Do not use those editors.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The TeXWorks editor is satisfactory. Be sure that you do not run scripts that change the content of your document.</p>
</div><!-- end 1.2.8 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.9">1.2.9. Suggestion: Write Using a Word Processor</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.9">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Write your book first. Code TeX later.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> A good word processor has advanced spell checking, and may also be able to detect some grammatical errors. I use <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> (also <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://portableapps.com/apps/office/libreoffice_portable">Portable</a>), version 5.3 or later.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Remember that styles and formats from a word processor <i>do not</i> translate to TeX styles and formats.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Since your document uses utf-8 encoding, you may allow a word processor to automatically substitute curly quotes, curly apostrophe, and emdash. Beware of incorrect direction of apostrophe, in expressions such as <i>Give &rsquo;em hell</i>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> Export plain text as utf-8 (without BOM).</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>F.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> For the editing and proofreading phase, in a word processor, I use a special font <i>CPmodified.otf</i>. This is my custom derivative of the <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/">Courier Prime</a> regular font.</p>
<p><i>CPmodified</i> can be found in the documentation <i>extras</i> folder. It is released under the SIL Open Font License v.1.1. To use this font in a word processor, install it in your <i>operating system</i>, not TeX.</p>
<p>The font includes Latin-1 and ANSI characters, and a few others. It is not quite monospaced (the em dash and ellipsis are longer). Punctuation is highly exaggerated, so you can see it more easily. My own experience is that most errors in the nearly-finished document involve punctuation. Sample, using a word processor:</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/CPmodified-sample.png" width="518" height="61" title="sample using CPmodified" alt="sample using CPmodified"/></p>
</div><!-- end 1.2.9 -->

<h4 id="h1.2.10">1.2.10. Paragraph Layout</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d1.2.10">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> In <i>novel</i>, inter-line spacing is fixed. There is no padding between paragraphs. No plus/minus "flexible glue." This is standard for printed fiction.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> When TeX processes a document on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, it chooses the layout that has the least total "penalty." Penalties are assessed based on factors such as word spacing, hyphenation, widows, and orphans (clubs). <i>Novel</i> applies a moderately strong penalty to hyphens; they are allowed, but discouraged. Widows and orphans are penalized very little. Word spacing, and even the spacing and characters within words, are controlled by moderate settings of the built-in <i>microtype</i> package.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>C.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> You are likely to find widows and orphans on many pages. If you wish to remove them, you must edit your text. This choice was made for several reasons: First, attention to widows and orphans would reduce the effectiveness of the other, more important, layout penalties. Second, fiction often has numerous short paragraphs (especially with dialogue), and it is very difficult for software to deal with all of them. Third, a great deal of contemporary fiction allows widows and orphans, when they are not distracting.</p>

<h2 id="h3">3. Metadata, File Data, and PDF/X</h2>
<div class="d2" id="d3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The commands described on this page are used only in the Preamble.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> These commands write non-printing information to the PDF file. Some of the information is used to identify and classify the file. Other information is read by the printer, to assist it with printing choices.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>C.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Some of the terms have different meanings, depending on whether they are used in the context of printing, book distribution, or ebooks. To avoid confusion <em>within this documentation</em> I will use different terms when they mean different things. When you are communicating with your printing and distribution service, take care to ensure that your understanding of terminology is what they really mean.</p>

<h3 id="h3.1">3.1. Definition of Terms</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d3.1">
<p class="noindent">This section is more detailed than it needs to be, because my review of various online forums (unrelated to TeX) shows a lot of user confusion.</p>

<h4 id="h3.1.1">3.1.1. ISBN Metadata</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.1.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> When you obtain the ISBN for your book, either directly through the issuing agency or via your chosen print service, you will enter <em>ISBN Metadata</em> in an online form.</p>
<p class="item"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/bookmanglerdashboard.png" width="500" height="309" alt="online form for ISBN metadata"/><b>B.</b> This metadata goes into a database, and identifies your printed book in distribution and sales channels. It neither knows nor cares about PDF. (If you were marketing a PDF ebook, instead of print, that would be a different story.)</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> ISBN Metadata includes title, author(s), subtitle if any, ISBN, and other identifying information. Once the book is released, this information (normally) cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> You may also enter a description, genre classification, and other information that will help people find your book by browsing, and help to sell your book. This information can usually be changed at a later date.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>E.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> The ISBN refers to your <em>printed book</em>, not to the PDF file. You are not selling copies of the PDF.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end 3.1.1 -->

<h4 id="h3.1.2">3.1.2. Printed Metadata</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.1.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> <em>Printed Metadata</em> refers to the information that can be seen on paper, in expected places: the book cover, the title page, and the copyright page.</p>
<p class="item"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/megatitlepagesm.png" width="165" height="256" alt="printed metadata, cover page"/><b>B.</b> Whether your book was printed from a PDF file, or by some other method, is not relevant.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Your print service will insist that the title, subtitle (if any), author, and ISBN in these places exactly match what appears in the ISBN database. Of course, you can (and usually will) use styling or images to make the Printed Metadata more attractive than the plain-text ISBN Metadata.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Some print services may object to artwork that is too fancy, on the grounds that it is difficult to discern the title and author. Although this is very unlikely, it is better to ask before committing resources.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end 3.1.2 -->

<h4 id="h3.1.3">3.1.3. File Data (PDF Metadata)</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.1.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Your PDF has internal metadata, which can been seen by PDF reader software.</p>
<p class="item"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/megadocprops.png" width="298" height="215" alt="PDF metadata"/><b>B.</b> To avoid confusion, this documentation uses the term <i>File Data</i> to mean this internal PDF Metadata.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> You can see some of the File Data when you open the PDF in any reader, and go to <i>File&gt;Properties</i>. To see all of it, you need professional software (such as Adobe Acrobat Pro).</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Be sure to read the rules for File Data, below. Some of it is generic, and some is particular to TeX or to the <i>novel</i> class.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end 3.1.3 -->
</div><!-- end 3.1 -->

<h3 id="h3.2">3.2. Rules for File Data</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d3.2">
<p class="item">File Data must conform to several specifications, in terms of what you may or may not write. Some of the limitations are imposed by the book distribution industry, which stores information in its databases a certain way.</p>
<p>What File Data do you need, if any? Ask your print service.</p>

<h4 id="h3.2.1">3.2.1. Required, Prohibited, Optional?</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.2.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> If PDF/X compliance is required, then you <em>must</em> at least set the title in File Data, using the <code><a href="#h3.3.1">\SetTitle</a></code> command. Note that this title is not styled in any way.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Some print services require a minimum amount of file data, particularly title and author, which must match the printed metadata and ISBN metadata for these fields.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Other services may require that the book's ISBN number, with something like <i>_text</i> added, be used in place of the title. Remember that underscore is a special character in LaTeX, so it must be preceded by a backslash.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Many print services do not care about File Data, one way or the other. Your PDF is passed through production according to its file name, not its internals. In such a case, assume that title and author are required.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>E.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Be sure that any included images are stripped of their own image metadata. The procedure is described in <a href="#h7.2">section 7.2</a>.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.2.1 -->

<h4 id="h3.2.2">3.2.2. Limited to Latin-1?</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.2.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> At least in the USA, your print service may require that File Data be limited to characters in the Latin-1 set. This is because their production and distribution software uses Latin-1 for the database.</a>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Latin-1 does not include curly quotes or em dash. You will still be using utf-8 encoding in your document files, but your choice of characters is restricted.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> <i>Novel</i> allows the title, and other File Data, to be in alphabets such as Greek or Cyrillic. If you are limited to Latin-1, the limitation has nothing to do with TeX or PDF.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> If your book has File Data using quotes, then use the special commands <code>\straightquote{}</code> and <code>\straightdblquote{}</code>. Be sure to use the braces, so that you don't have to worry about gobbled space. When you use these commands, you eliminate the risk that your software will automatically convert them to the forbidden curly quotes. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetTitle{That\straightquote{}s Amore}  % That's Amore</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> If you are limited to Latin-1 in File Data, you can still use curly quotes and em dash on the cover and title page, and in headings.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>F.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> There is no <code>\maketitle</code> command in <i>novel</i>. You may (and should) apply styling to the printed title, even though the File Data title cannot be styled.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.2.2 -->

<h4 id="h3.2.3">3.2.3. TeX escapes</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.2.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> In File Data, you must obey the same TeX rules that apply everywhere: Certain characters have special meaning, and must be preceded by a backslash, if you wish to use them as ordinary characters.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The list of special characters:</p>
<p><code># $ % &amp;</code> &nbsp; &nbsp; (hash, dollar, percent, ampersand)</p>
<p>Example: The title <em>Doing 9% &amp; Gone</em> is coded:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetTitle{Doing 9\% \&amp; Gone}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The above characters are rarely needed in File Data. Sometimes they must be spelled out, in order to agree with your book's ISBN Metadata. For example, you may need to write "and" rather than the ampersand, "dollar" rather than the dollar symbol, and "percent" or "per-cent" rather than the percent symbol.</p>

</div><!-- end 3.2.3 -->

<h4 id="h3.2.4">3.2.4. Forbidden Characters</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.2.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Do not use the backslash <code>\</code> except as described above.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Do not use the tilde <code>~</code> or the circumflex <code>^</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Do not use TeX code, such as <code>\`e</code> for e with grave; instead paste <code>è</code> directly from a character map.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Do not use styling, such as <code>{\small text}</code> or <code>\textit{text}</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> If necessary, use <code>\straightquote{}</code> and <code>\straightdblquote{}</code>. Do not use TeX code for apostrophe or quote.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> Do not use multiple hyphens to create longer dashes. Do not use em dash or en dash.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.2.4 -->
</div><!-- end 3.2 -->

<h3 id="h3.3">3.3. File Data Commands</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d3.3">
<p class="noindent">Now that you understand what File Data means, and how it may be written, you can use commands to write it.</p>

<h4 id="h3.3.1">3.3.1. <code>\SetTitle{<em>text</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.3.1">
<p class="noindent"><i>Default title has changed from version 1.46.1. See <a href="#hNI.5">News NI.5</a></i></p>
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <i>novel</i> document class does not have <code>\maketitle</code>. The title is <i>not</i> automatically transferred to a title page, because there is no automatic title page.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The title can be retrieved as <code>\theTitle</code> anywhere in your document.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> In certain page layouts, the title is used as default text in recto page headings. You may over-ride this behavior. See <a href="#h4.3.4.6">section 4.3.4.6</a>.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> You may set the title as empty (or blank space). In <i>very rare</i> cases, that is useful. However, if you do that, then you must follow <code>\SetTitle{}</code> with <code>\SetPDFX{off}</code>, or an error will result. This is because PDF/X standards require a real title.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.3.1 -->

<h4 id="h3.3.2">3.3.2. <code>\SetAuthor{<em>text</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.3.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The default author is empty (no author).</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> In certain page layouts, the author is used as default text in verso page headings. You may over-ride this behavior. See <a href="#h4.3.4.6">section 4.3.4.6</a>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The author can be retrieved as <code>\theAuthor</code> anywhere in your document.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Use the name as it is spoken. <i>Correct:</i> Mary Smith. <i>Incorrect:</i> Smith, Mary. <i>Possibly correct, if true:</i> Mary Smith, Ph. D.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> Your PDF file is <i>not</i> seen by a public database. Instead, the public database contains the information you entered, when you obtained the ISBN. See <a href="#h3.1.1">section 3.1.1</a>. So, if you have multiple authors or minor contributors, that is the place to provide search information.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> Ask your print service about how to enter multiple authors, and how to display them in print.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>G.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Print-On-Demand services do not like to split royalty payments among multiple authors. Instead, the entire account is the responsibility of one main author or editor.</p>
<p>If anyone else is involved, that is a matter of private contract betwen the one main author/editor, and any other contributors. The print service neither knows nor cares about such agreements, and will do nothing to cooperate.</p>
<p>[DISCLAIMER] Here is my amateur advice: Consider using other contributors on a <i><span style="white-space:nowrap">work-for-hire</span></i> basis. This involves a written contract, prior payment of a fixed amount that does not depend on sales, and no grant of rights. You also need written assurance that the hired persons have the right to sell you the work they provide. If you need professional advice, then consult a professional.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.3.2 -->

<h4 id="h3.3.3">3.3.3. <code>\SetSubtitle{<em>text</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.3.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The subtitle can be retrieved as <code>\theSubtitle</code> anywhere in your document.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The subtitle does <i>not</i> appear in File Data, and does <i>not</i> appear anywhere in your book, unless you manually write it there (either manually, or via <code>\theSubtitle</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If you want the subtitle to appear in File Data, manually include it via <code>\SetTitle</code>. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetTitle{Megabarf: The Green Plague of London}</code></p>
<p>Then, you may need to adjust page headings so that only the main title appears. See <a href="#h4.3.4.6">section 4.3.4.6</a>.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Usually, there is no benefit to including the subtitle in File Data. The search database does not read your PDF. It reads the information you entered as <a href="#h3.1.1">ISBN Metadata</a>, which does have an entry for subtitle.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.3.3 -->

<h4 id="h3.3.4">3.3.4 Advanced: <code>\SetApplication{<em>text</em>}</code> and <code>\SetProducer{<em>text</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.3.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <i>Application</i>, also known as <i>CreatorTool</i>, is the program used to create your source document. Text editors, word processors, and page layout programs are the most common Applications (not specific to TeX).</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The PDF <i>Producer</i> is the program that converts the source document to PDF. In many cases, the Producer is a back-end, directly linked to the Application.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> These details are automatically created when you compile your document, without any input from you. However, if you have the need to provide a custom text string for the Application or Producer, these commands will do it.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.3.4 -->
</div><!-- end 3.3 -->

<h3 id="h3.4">3.4. PDF/X</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d3.4">
<p class="item"><i>New in version 1.46.1: Default settings changed. See <a href="#hNI.5">News NI.5</a>.</i></p>
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Commercial printers are very likely to require PDF/X compliance. This ensures that your PDF meets a variety of criteria, by containing those things it must contain, and omitting those things it must not contain.</a>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Most perfectly valid PDF files are <em>not</em> PDF/X compliant, simply because they are not intended for commercial printing.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> To set PDF/X compliance, use this command in Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetPDFX[<em>OutputIntent</em>]{<em>ComplianceStandard</em>}</code> &nbsp; and starred version</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> A non-PDF/X file is not a defective file! It complies with PDF standards, but not PDF/X standards. Some print services insist on PDF/X. Others don't care, as long as the fonts are embedded (which they always are).</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>E.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Some document class options are not used for final print production. When you use these options, PDF/X will be temporarily turned <i>off</i>, regardless of your setting.</p>

<h4 id="h3.4.1">3.4.1. Compliance Standards</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.4.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The following choices are available:</p>
<p><code>X-1a:2001</code> (default)</p>
<p><code>X-1a:2003</code></p>
<p><code>X-3:2002</code></p>
<p><code>X-3:2003</code></p>
<p><code>off</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The first of these is the one that is most widely accepted in commercial printing. Anything meeting X-1a:2001 necessarily meets the other standards.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If your book involved complicated color artwork, then the correct choice might be crucial. But for a black and white book block, <span style="white-space:nowrap">X-1a:2001</span> is the preferred choice, unless your print service says otherwise.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.4.1 -->

<h4 id="h3.4.2">3.4.2. Output Intent</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.4.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Output Intent informs the printer that you "intend" your PDF to be printed according to certain technical capabilities, particularly regarding color.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If your are using color-managed workflow with a calibrated monitor and color profile, and if the actual printer matches your intent, then you can expect accurate printed colors within the technical limits.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If the intended printer does not match the actual printer, there are three possible results: (1) The file will still be printed, but colors may be inaccurate. Home and office printers do this routinely. (2) If the printer is very advanced, it will adjust its properties to emulate the intended printer. (3) The printer may reject the print job, because it knows that it cannot produce the intended results.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> The above considerations are very important for glossy fashion magazines, somewhat important for color book covers, and unimportant for non-color book text. Nevertheless, an Output Intent is required to meet PDF/X compliance, even when it does not matter.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> The Output Intent is an optional argument to <code>\SetPDFX</code>, because a default will be used when the Intent is not specified.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.4.2 -->

<h4 id="h3.4.3">3.4.3. Built-in Output Intent Codes</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d3.4.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> There are three pre-defined choices for Output Intent:</p>
<p><code>CGATS TR 001</code> (default) (can also use CGATSTR001)</p>
<p><code>FOGRA39</code></p>
<p><code>JC200103</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The first of these is known as "US&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Coated&nbsp;SWOP&nbsp;v2" in the USA, and is the most commonly-used American print standard for this kind of book.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The second is widely used in Europe, the third in Japan.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.4.3 -->

<h4 id="h3.4.4">
3.4.4. Other Output Intents</h4><div class="d4" id="d3.4.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> If you are required to use an Output Intent that is not one of the above three, then you have to code it yourself.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> In a place where TeX can find it, create a plain text file with its file name in the following format:</p>
<p class="code">File name begins with <code>novel-</code> (note the hyphen).</p>
<p class="code">No spaces or underscores in file name, no matter what the Intent.</p>
<p class="code">File extension is <code>.clo</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Example valid file name: <code>novel-YourIntent.clo</code>.</p>
<p class="code">The above file is loaded using <code>\SetPDFX[YourIntent]{<em>compliance</em>}</code>.</p> 
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> The file contains (up to) five <code>\gdef</code> commands. The <code>\@OIidentifier</code> is called "reference name" by some authorities. Here is the code used for <code>CGATS TR 001</code>:</p>:
<div style="margin:0px 16px 0px 16px; background: #dddddd none">
<p class="code"><code>\gdef\@OIidentifier{CGATS TR 001}</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\gdef\@OIcondition{SWOP (Publication) printing in USA (Printing process definition: ANSI CGATS.6).}</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\gdef\@OIinfo{U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2}</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\gdef\@OIregistry{http://www.color.org}</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\gdef\@OIprofile{USWebCoatedSWOP.icc}</code></p>
</div>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> If the data contains any TeX special characters, such as underscore, percent, ampersand, or number sign, they must be escaped using a backslash.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> The necessary data may be provided by your print service, or perhaps can be found at resources such as the <a href="http://color.org/registry/index.xalter" rel="external" class="external" target="new">International Color Consortium</a>. Alas, this source (and others) do not make it easy to discern the data.</p>
<p class="item"><b>G.</b> Another place to look for Output Intent data is in your (texmf)/tex/latex/pdfx folder. This will be in your TeX system if package <i>pdfx</i> is installed (but do not load this package into <i>novel</i> class). Files <i>AdobeColorProfiles.tex</i> and <i>AdobeExternalProfiles.tex</i> contain code prepared by the author of the <i>pdfx</i> package. The macro names are not the same, but they are easy to decode: <code>\@OIidentifer</code> is <i>/OutputConditionIdentifier</i>; <code>\@OIcondition</code> is <i>/ProfileName</i>; <code>\@OIinfo</code> is <i>/OutputCondition</i>; <code>\@OIregistry</code> is <i>/RegistryName</i>; and <code>\@OIprofile</code> follows <i>\setCMYKcolorprofile</i>.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.4.4 -->

<h4 id="h3.4.5">
3.4.5. Whether or Not to Embed *.icc</h4><div class="d4" id="d3.4.5">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Each Output Intent has a color profile, in the form of a file with extension <i>*.icc</i>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> You usually do not need the color profile, because the printer knows which profile corresponds with which standard Output Intent code.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> When you use <code>\SetPDFX</code> in its un-starred form, the *.icc color profile will not be embedded in the PDF. This is the normal situation.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> If your print service demands that you embed the *.icc color profile, then use <code>\SetPDFX*</code> (with the asterisk). You must have the actual *.icc file available where TeX can find it.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> Do not embed the *.icc color profile unless specifically requested by your print service. If you embed it when you should not, the result may be worse!</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> If your printer requests "US Web Coated SWOP v2" and, as usual, requests that you <em>not</em> embed the corresponding *.icc color profile, then some software will read the Output Intent as "CGATS&nbsp;TR&nbsp;001" instead of "US&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Coated&nbsp;SWOP&nbsp;v2". They are identical.</p>
</div><!-- end 3.4.5 -->

<h4 id="h3.4.6">
3.4.6. Where to Find *.icc Files</h4><div class="d4" id="d3.4.6">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> You do not need an *.icc color profile unless you choose to embed it.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Although many *.icc color profiles are freely available, they usually cannot be distributed within an open-source project. You might already have them in your system, wherever such files are stored. Note that TeX uses forward slash in file paths, not backslash, even if the platform is Windows:</p>
<p class="isolate">
Windows: <code>C:/Windows/System32/spool/drivers/color/</code><br/>
Linux: <code>/usr/share/color</code> or hidden <code>~/.local/share/icc/</code> or other places<br/>
OSX: <code>/Library/Colorsync/Profiles/</code> or hidden <code>(username)/Library/Colorsync/Profiles/</code>
</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If you do not have a file you need, look on the Internet <a href="https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/iccprofiles/icc_eula_win_end.html" target="new">here</a> and <a href="http://www.color.org/profiles.xalter" target="new">here</a>. These links also have many other profiles, beyond the basic three.</a>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> In a few cases, your print service may provide the necessary *.icc file.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> You want <i>printer</i> profiles, usually CMYK. Don't worry about the files being "for Windows," as they are actually cross-platform.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> If your system has the necessary <i>*.icc</i> file for your Output Intent, but <i>novel</i> cannot find it, then copy the file to the same folder as your TeX document.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>G.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Again: Do not embed the color profile unless the printer requests embedding.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d4.1.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> In PDF terminology, <b>Media Size</b> is the size of the PDF page. It is internally defined by the <b>MediaBox</b>. By default, it is identical to the Trim Size. Do not set it manually, unless you must.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> When you print at home, most printers will automatically adjust the Media Size, so that it fits the actual paper in the printer's tray.</p>
<p>Some advanced printers will halt, and inform you that the PDF Media Size does not fit the available paper; then you will be asked whether you wish to proceed.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Sheet-fed commercial printers work the same way as your home printer. Usually, the PDF Media Size is automatically adjusted to fit the available paper. Trim Size is unaffected.</p>
<p>Some printers are programmed to halt when they see a Media Size misfit. This is a big nuisance, because commercial printers rely on rapid production. In this case, the print service will demand that you set the PDF Media Size equal to their actual paper sheet size. The TrimBox will float within the MediaBox.</p>

The invisible <b>TrimBox</b> is outlined in green. Anything outside the TrimBox does not appear in the finished book.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> When you request PDF/X compliance, the TrimBox is automatically added. If Trim Size equals Media Size, then the TrimBox is at the outer edges of the PDF.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> If you are required to float the Trim Size in a larger Media Size, is is globally set in Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetMediaSize[<em>alignment</em>]{<em>width</em>}{<em>height</em>}</code></p>
<p>By default, the TrimBox is horizontally and vertically centered in the MediaBox. If the optional <i>alignment</i> is set to <code>corner</code> then the TrimBox will be placed at a corner of the MediaBox (verso at upper left, recto at upper right, so they are back-to-back). Do not use <code>corner</code> unless requested by your print service. However, if you are hand-making a sample copy at home, using <code>corner</code> will reduce the amount of cutting.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d4.2.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> In <i>novel</i> you do not directly set the main font (also known as <i>roman default</i>). Instead, you set a parent font, from which the main font is derived.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The default parent font is <i>Libertinus Serif</i>, which is an up-to-date branch of <i>Linux Libertine O</i>. You must install it as package <i>libertinus</i>. If you do not have this font, then <i>Latin Modern Roman</i> will be used as fallback, but it is not really suitable for use in printed fiction.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Choose only Open Type or TrueType fonts, not the ancient Type 1 (PostScript) or Metafonts. The font you choose does not have to be part of any TeX package, because you do not need any <i>*.sty</i> file or TeX metrics. All of that is built into the font itself. This is thanks to <i>LuaLaTeX</i> and the built-in <i>fontspec</i> package.</p>

<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The size may be any units TeX understands, including decimal values. So, <i>12.8bp</i> and <i>13.1pt</i> are acceptable. This is because you will be using scalable, Open&nbsp;Type and TrueType fonts throughout your document. They do not need TeX metrics.<p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If you insist on using ancient TeX fonts, then you may need to specify a convenient integer font size such as 11pt or 12pt. But why? Forget those fonts! Welcome to the Twenty-First Century.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> The minimum normal font size is <i>8pt</i>, and the maximum is <i>18bp</i>. On a local basis, text may be larger or smaller than this.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> If you do not use this command, the default font size will be set to <i>11.4pt</i> more or less. That is, the size is calculated from other layout settings.

<p class="item"><b>F.</b> Once you have set the Trim Size, margins, and parent font, set the font size for readability. Depending on whom you ask, each line of free-running text should average 60 to 66 characters (including spaces).

<h4 id="h4.2.5">4.2.5. Advanced: Defining New Font Commands</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d4.2.5">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> You can define new font commands in Preamble. The syntax depends on whether the new font is part of a family (where you might have bold and italic variants), or just a single file (no variants). If part of a family, use <code>\NewFontFamily</code>. If alone, use <code>\NewFontFace</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>\NewFontFamily</code> command (or <code>\NewFontFace</code>) takes three arguments: First, the name you assign to the new font command is required. Second, font features are optional. Third, the font name is required. The <i>fontspec</i> syntax is used in Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\NewFontFamily<em>\pickaname</em>[<em>features</em>]{<em>fontfamily</em>}<br/>
\NewFontFace<em>\pickaname</em>[<em>features</em>]{<em>singlefont</em>}
</code></p>
<p>In the document body, you use the new font command:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\pickaname Text in the font selected by pickaname command.}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you define a font <em>family</em> when you should have just defined a font <em>face</em>, there will be complaints in the log file, because the font loader cannot find the (nonexistent) other members of the family. But the document will compile.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you define a font <em>face</em> when you should have defined a font <em>family</em>, then commands for bold or italic will have no effect, since the other family members were not loaded. Again, the document will compile.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Example: Suppose your work is science fiction, and one if its characters is a talking robot. You wish to depict its utterances in a robotic-looking font, which will be called using a new <code>\robovoice</code> command. You shop around, and find that the <em>Orbitron</em> font suits your purpose, except that it is too large compared to your <i>main font</i>. So, you scale it.</p>
<p>In the Preamble, you define the new font command:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\NewFontFace\robovoice[Scale=0.8]{Orbitron} % not part of a family</code></p>
<p>After some experimentation, you realize that the \robovoice letters need to be spread apart a bit. Do not use the standard LaTeX <code>\textls</code> command. Instead, go back and change the font definition like this:
<p class="code"><code>\NewFontFace\robovoice[Scale=0.8,LetterSpace=<em>number</em>]{Orbitron} % pick a number</code></p>
<p>In the document body:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
``Want some oil?'' asked Captain Withens.\par<br/>
{\robovoice ``Is it Gamma-42 Special oil?''} asked the robot.\par<br/>
``No, I got it on sale at Cosmo-Mart.''\par<br/>
{\robovoice ``Forget it. I'm an oil gourmet.''}\par

<h4 id="h4.3.1">4.3.1. Margins</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d4.3.1">
<p class="noindent">Margins are globally set in Preamble:</p>

<p>Mnemonic for order of margins: "TOBI, or not TOBI, that is the question."</p>
<p>Each of the settings must have dimension, such as <i>in</i> or <i>mm</i>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> <b>Margins</b> are required on all four edges of the page. They do not have to be the same width. Generally the margin at the inside edge (spine margin) is wider. The <i>novel</i> class does not provide for marginal notes.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> In the case of fiction, it is usually the case that the inner margin is the widest. But this is not a rule for all books. All that is required is that each margin be "wide enough" for the printing process.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Print services are not used to seeing books with exotic margins (such as bottom margin twice the size of top margin). They may think that there is a mistake in your PDF, or in the print job, if you do that.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Normally, your TeX document will be compiled to a PDF that is electronically at the exact Trim Size. And normally, print services want it to be that way. When you view your PDF, the text will shift from side to side as you move through the pages, due to the slightly increased margin at the inside edge.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> <img class="floatright" src="html-resources/margins-trim-media.png" width="202" height="264" title="Trim Size floated in larger Media Size" alt="Trim Size floated in larger Media Size"/>Margins are always relative to the Trim Size. If you are using a larger Media Size, the area outside the TrimBox is <i>not</i> counted among the margins; it is simply wasted area. This is illustrated at right, where a smaller Trim Size is floated in a marger Media Size. The margins are shown in gray.</p> 
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> If you do not use this command, then margins are pre-configured. The minimum pre-configured margins are 0.5in at top, outside, and bootm, and 0.75in at inside. This meets the requirements of nearly any printing technology, unless your book is extremely thick. If your Trim Size is among the larger ones, then the pre-configured margins are larger than these minimums.</p>
<p class="item"><b>G.</b> If your pages have header/footer, they sit inside the rectangle bounded by the four margins. That is, they do <i>not</i> sit inside the marginal areas.</p>

<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Some printers describe the unsafe zone as "minimum margins." But in most cases, visually appealing margins are wider than the unsafe zone. If so, then there will be an area that lies outside the margins, but inside the safe zone. You may be able to place items there, for special effects.</p>

<h5 id="h4.3.3.2">4.3.3.2. Custom Header/Footer Style</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d4.3.3.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Before you think about writing a custom header/footer style, be sure to try the above pre-configured choices. I have looked through a lot of fiction of all kinds. The pre-configured choices include every style I have seen, with the exception of the most highly decorative.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If none of the above are satisfactory, then you can write your own headers and footers using the syntax of the <i>fancyhdr</i> package. Strategy:</p>
<p>&bull; In the Preamble, you must use one of the above <code>\SetHeadFootStyle</code> choices to pick a starting point, in terms of whether or not there is a header and/or footer. <em>This is required, so that the layout engine knows how to calculate space.</em> After that, write the <i>fancyhdr</i> code for your custom header/footer in the Preamble. It will over-ride the numerical style in terms of appearance, but occupy the same space.</p>
<p>&bull; You cannot use a header or footer with more than one line. No exceptions.</p>
<p>&bull; See the file <i>novel-HeadFootStyles.sty</i> for how it is done in the pre-configured styles. In the file, the relevant portion follows <em>Look here for the pre-defined styles, for use as models.</em></p>
<p>&bull; Particularly note that your own style will not automatically use the <i>head font</i>, or add extra space between letters, unless you include the necessary code in your own definition. Do not use the <code>\textls</code> command.</p>
<p>&bull; No cheating! If you choose a numerical style that does not have a header, then do not attempt to write a custom style that includes a header. Same with footer. Also, if you you choose a numerical style with both header and footer, then you cannot only customize one of them; you must customize both.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d4.3.4">

<p class="code"><code>\SetHeadJump{<em>number</em>}</code>, <code>\SetFootJump{<em>number</em>}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> These two commands control the separation between the header/footer and the main text. If your style does not have a header and/or footer, then the corresponding setting will be ignored.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> When you change the "jump," the header or footer remains in the same place. However, the inter-line spacing (baseline skip) of the main text is tweaked to fit, while maintaining the same number of lines per page. Thus, there is no problem with the margins.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Note that <i>novel</i> does not use arcane settings such as <i>headsep</i>, <i>footskip</i>, or <i>headheight</i>. Those TeX internals are automatically calculated.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> The head and/or foot "jump" is a multiple of the normal baseline skip. Each value is a number between 1 and 3, and may be decimal. The jumps do not need to be identical. Default is 1.5 for each. Measurements are from baseline to baseline.</p>
<p class="centerimg" style="text-indent:0px"><img src="html-resources/header-footer-measurements.png" width="700" height="378" alt="measurements at top and bottom" title="measurements at top and bottom"/></p>

This provides adequate clearance for capital letters with upper diacritical marks. The distance from the lowermost baseline (whether main text or footer), to the lower margin, is fixed at 0.3 normal em. This provides adequate clearance for descenders.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> When in draft mode, the <code>shademargins</code> option shades the margins in medium gray, and shades the area reserved for header/footer in light gray. This was used in the above image.</p>

<div class="d5" id="d4.3.4.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <i>novel</i> pre-configured header/footer styles automatically use the <em>head font</em>, which is pre-defined as a variation of the parent font: scaled to slightly smaller size, using lining numbers (if available), and small caps (if available). This is a general-purpose style, widely used in fiction. It may not be the most artistic, but it is unlikely to cause visual distraction:</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/headfont-default.png" width="419" height="81" title="default head font" alt="default head font"/></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you would like to use something else as <i>head font</i>, use <code>\SetHeadFont</code> to define it by its font name and Open Type features.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, you merely pick an Open Type (or TrueType) font, and <i>novel</i> automatically adds some Open Type features, including small caps:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetHeadFont{Roboto}</code></p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/headfont-roboto.png" width="419" height="81" title="Roboto head font" alt="Roboto head font"/></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The above example is not best if your style has header text, because the <i>head font</i> is too pronounced, compared to the main text. A more complex example uses <i>fontspec</i> syntax to customize the Open Type Features:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetHeadFont[Scale=0.75,Numbers=Lining,%<br/>
Letters=SmallCaps,%<br/>

<p class="item"><b>A.</b> This command applies to both headers and footers, but its effect is most noticeable when the style has header text.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> For best appearance of header text, its characters should be adjusted with a little extra space (tracking) between them, so that they are more easily distinguished from the main text. This is especially true if you are using small caps.</p>

<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The argument of <code>\SetLooseHead</code> is a number from <i>0</i> to <i>200</i>. At <i>0</i> there is no extra space between the letters. Values from <i>50</i> (default) to <i>100</i> are most useful.</p>

<div class="d5" id="d4.3.4.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> By default, the page number is styled using <i>head font</i>, but without small caps (so that page roman xiv does not show as XIV).</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you wish to change how the page number is displayed, you can style it using <code>\SetPageNumber</code> with an argument that uses <code>\thepage</code>. Examples:</p>

\SetPageNumberStyle{-- \thepage{} --} % En-dashes, head/foot style 3 or 5.</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The <i>head font</i> is applied automatically, unless you over-ride it in your code. For example, suppose you would like the page numbers (but not anything else in header/footer) to be in a different font, which you have defined in Preamble as <code>\yourpnfont</code> using <code>\NewFontFamily</code> or <code>\NewFontFace</code>.

<p class="item"><b>A.</b> If the head/foot style supports it, you may place an "emblem" that appears at a fixed distance (2.5em) from the outer margin. Thus, it will appear to the right of the page number on verso pages, and to the left of the page number on recto pages. In the case of style <i>4</i>, there will be a clearance of 1em between the emblem and the header text.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Emblems are minor decorations that should not distract the eye from the main text. If the style supports emblems but you do not set them, then no emblems are placed.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> <img class="floatright" src="html-resources/emblembar.png" width="380" height="104" alt="simple emblems using vertical bar"/>&bull; Most books do not use an emblem. When they do, it is typically a vertical bar, or a bullet, like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetHeadFootStyle{4}</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetEmblems{|}{|}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> The font used for emblems will be the same as the <i>head font</i>, unless you specifically code the emblem to use a different font, or unless you use one of the built-in <code>\decoglyph</code> codes.</p>

<p class="item"><b>F.</b> <img class="floatright" src="html-resources/emblemdingbats.png" width="380" height="104" alt="dingbat emblems"/>&bull; Emblems may be styled.

If you use images, they must be at the exact resolution required by your print service (usually 300dpi for gray, 600dpi for b/w), and at exact size without scaling. The <code>\InlineImage</code> command must be used. See <i>novel's</i> image documentation details. You may find that a vertical offset of <code>\nfs</code> (normal font size) is useful, as this will place the top of the emblem image at the top margin.</p>

A black/white image at 600dpi will print similarly to a font dingbat. Grayscale at 300dpi will probably not be satisfactory unless the emblem is a single shade of gray. For the above example, a character from the <i>Fontawesome</i> font was converted to a png image at mid-gray. It is less distracting than a black character from the font, but hard to discern. Note that "gray ink" will not be used for your book.</p>
<p>Ask your print service whether the presence of a small image in each page header will affect production costs. Probably not, but if there is a different per-page charge when pages have an image... Oops!</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>I.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> The layout calculation does not care whether emblems intrude into the margins. You will have to inspect your PDF to determine whether a header emblem is too tall, or a footer emblem too deep, for the allowed top and bottom margin clearance. Class option <i>shademargins</i> (in draft mode only) is helpful.</p>

<p class="item"><b>A.</b> If you are using head/foot style <i>1</i>, <i>4</i>, <i>5</i>, or <i>6</i>, it has text in the header. By default, that text is the author on verso pages, the title on recto pages. That is an accepted design for fiction, but it is not always the appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p>For example, in exotic cases you may use something such as <code>\SetTitle{ISBN9780123456789TEXTBLOCK}</code>, instead of the book's actual title, if required for the printer's database. Obviously you do not want that to appear in page headings!</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Header text may be changed to whatever you wish (as long as it fits):</p>

<p class="item"><b>D.</b> You may use ordinary LaTeX styling commands for the text:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetRectoHeadText{The \emph{Bad Boy} Chronicles}</code></p>
<p>You may also do more complicated things, such as setting certain words in a font other than the <i>head font</i>. This is not advised, because you do not want to distract the reader from the main text; but it can be done.</p>

<h4 id="h4.3.5">4.3.5. Header/Footer Exceptional Pages</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d4.3.5">
<p class="noindent">There are a number of cases where a specific page must have a header/footer style that appears to differ from the global style. The key words are "appears to differ." The global header/footer is always there, in terms of vertical space. But either or both may be blank, or have unusual content, on certain pages.</p>

<h5 id="h4.3.5.1">4.3.5.1. <code>\thispagestyle{<em>choice</em>}</code></h5>
<div class="d5" id="d4.3.5.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Command <code>\thispagestyle</code> is used in the document body, not Preamble. It changes the appearance of header/footer, only for the page on which the command appears. Ideally the command is used immediately after <code>\clearpage</code> or <code>\cleartorecto</code>, so that the applicable page is certain.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The command will be effective if used anywhere on a page, as long as you are certain <i>which</i> page is current. So, if you know that a particular portion of text runs exactly two pages before <code>\clearpage</code>, you can use <code>\thispagestyle</code> at the beginning and end of the text, so that it applies to both pages.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The choice of page style is <i>not</i> one of the numbered global head/foot styles. Instead, choose from the following list. These are more versatile than the choices available in other TeX document classes. They are: <i>fancy</i>, <i>empty</i>, <i>footer</i>, <i>forcenumber</i>, <i>dropfoliobeneath</i>, and <i>dropfolioinside</i>.</p>
<p class="overhang"><code><b>\thispagestyle{fancy}</b></code><br/>
This applies the default (fancy) page style, so it is not normally needed. Only use this command to over-ride some other <code>\thispagestyle</code> command, or to over-ride the <code>\SetChapterStartStyle</code> setting.</p>
<p class="overhang"><code><b>\thispagestyle{empty}</b></code><br/>
Header and footer are both blank.</p>
<p class="overhang"><code><b>\thispagestyle{footer}</b></code><br/>
Ignored if the style has no footer. If it does, then the usual footer appears. Note that this does <i>not</i> cause a page number to appear, when the style has no footer. Header, if any, is blank.</p>
<p class="overhang"><code><b>\thispagestyle{forcenumber}</b></code><br/>
If the style has a footer, then it appears as usual, and the header (if any) is blank. If the style has a header but no footer, then the outside portion of the header (which is presumed to contain the page number and emblem) appears, but the text portion of the header is blank.<br/>
&bull; The <i>forcenumber</i> choice is non-standard. Use it only if you must have a page number, and no other choice is suitable.</p>
<p class="overhang"><code><b>\thispagestyle{dropfoliobeneath}</b></code><br/>
In this context, "folio" means page number. The header (if any) is blank. If there is a footer, then it appears as usual. But if there is no footer, this command creates a one-page fake footer, which contains the centered page number. The fake footer is located where the next line of text would be, if the textblock were one line longer than its actual value.<br/>
&bull; For the fake footer to be acceptable in print, the bottom margin must be wider than the minimum amount required by your print service. For example, suppose that the minimum bottom margin is 0.5in, but you set the bottom margin to 0.75in. That gives you 0.25in wiggle room, into which the fake footer will probably fit, because typical baselineskip is 0.2in to 0.25in.<br/>
&bull; The document class does not know whether or not you have extra space available in the bottom margin. It is your responsibility to know.</p>
<p class="overhang">&nbsp; <code><b>\thispagestyle{dropfolioinside}</b></code><br/>
In this context, "folio" means page number. The header (if any) is blank. If there is a footer, then it appears as usual. But if there is no footer, this commands temporarily reduces the number of lines per page by one. At the bottom, where the last line of text would normally be, the page number is centered. Thus, there is no intrusion into the bottom margin.<br/>
&bull; This command may only be used following <code>\clearpage</code>. Thus, it may be used at the start of new chapters, or on pages that do not flow from a previous page. If you use it elsewhere, the print will have incorrect layout, but there will be no error or warning, since the compiler is not sure what you are trying to do.<br/>
&bull; If used on a page with <i>ChapterStart</i> environment, you must place <code>\thispagestyle{dropfolioinside}</code> <em>before</em> <code>\begin{ChapterStart}</code>. Reason: The <i>ChapterStart</i> block has a disposable blank line at its top, which is removed when <i>dropfolioinside</i> is used (instead of removing a line from the following text block).<br/>
&bull; With this style, the specified height of <i>ChapterStart</i> must be <i>4</i> or more. This command will reduce it to 3 or more.</p>

<h2 id="h5">5. Chapters and Chapter-Like Sections</h2>
<div class="d2" id="d5">
<p class="noindent">This section describes how chapters are designed. The <i>novel</i> class has commands specifically for this purpose. Do not use the ordinary TeX <code>\chapter</code> command, or any other TeX partitioning such as <code>\section</code>.</p>
<p>This also applies to content that is styled like a chapter, regardless of what it is called or where it appears. For example, if your book's front matter has a Preface, it is probably styled like a chapter. Something such as Acknowledgements might or might not be styled like a chapter, depending on length. Advice can be found in <a href="#h8">section 8</a> of this documentation, regarding Book Design.</p>

<h3 id="h5.1">5.1. Starting a Chapter</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d5.1">

<h4 id="h5.1.1">5.1.1. <code>\clearpage</code> or <code>\cleartorecto</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.1.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Unless your chapters run continuously without page break, begin a new chapter using <code>\clearpage</code> or <code>\cleartorecto</code>. The first of these provides a new page, which will be verso or recto, without skipping a page. The second forces the chapter to begin on a recto page, if necessary inserting a blank verso.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The common modern practice in fiction is to allow new chapters to begin either verso or recto, once you get past Chapter One. The only recent book I've read (from a major publisher), where chapters always started recto, had about 20 blank pages throughout the story. I believe the reason was to pad the book, so that it looked bigger. If you are using an American P.O.D. service, such padding might knock about $0.10 (estimated) from your profit, for each copy sold. So it's up to you to think about the tradeoffs between style, profit per book, and expected sales.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Prologue (if any), Chapter One, Epilogue (if any), and other special sections always begin recto.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d5.1.3">
<p class="noindent">You can put anything you like within <i>ChapterStart</i>, including ordinary text and even images. All <i>ChapterStart</i> does is reserve a fixed space. However, there are special commands that make it easy to place a chapter title, chapter subtitle, and decorative element.</p>

<h5 id="h5.1.3.1">5.1.3.1. <code>\SetChapterFont[<em>features</em>]{<em>font</em>}</code><br/>
<span class="dbloc">5.1.3.1 &nbsp; </span><code>\SetSubchFont[<em>features</em>]{<em>font</em>}</code></h5>
<div class="d5" id="d5.1.3.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> These global commands may be used in Preamble. They create font commands <code>\chapterfont</code> and <code>\subchfont</code> that may be used to style text anywhere in your document, like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\chapterfont <em>text</em>}<br/>
{\subchfont <em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The <i>chapter font</i> is automatically applied to text in <code>\ChapterTitle</code> commands.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The <i>subch</i> font is automatically applied to text in chapter subtitles (see below).</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> These fonts are pre-configured, based on the document's parent font. They have TeX ligatures and kerning, and use Lining numbers instead of Old Style. The <i>chapter font</i> is scaled at 1.6, and the <i>subch font</i> is scaled at 1.2, compared to normal font size. Ordinary (common) ligatures are not used, because such ligatures are best avoided with enlarged text.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> If you don't like the pre-configured fonts, then you may specify your own, using <i>fontspec</i> syntax. Here is what the default codes look like:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetChapterFont[Numbers=Lining,Scale=1.6]{\parentfont}<br/>

<div class="d5" id="d5.1.3.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Text within <code>\ChapterTitle</code> is styled using the <i>chapter font</i>, and text within <code>\ChapterSubtitle</code> is automatically styled using the <i>subch font</i>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> You can locally over-ride these fonts, using font commands in the text.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The optional <i>alignment</i> controls how the element is horizontally placed. Choices are <i>l</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>r</i> (left, center, right). Default <i>c</i>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> You don't have to use either of these commands. Or, you can use either of them more than once! All these commands do is style the text. They do not have any meaning that is controlled by other macros.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> The styled text is limited to one line (no wrap) per command. If you have a long chapter title or subtitle, then break it into pieces of manageable size, by repeating the command(s). Example:</p>
<p class="code"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/chaptertitlesubtitle.png" width="338" height="179" title="chapter title and subtitle, left aligned" alt="chapter title and subtitle, left aligned"/>
<code><small>

<h5 id="h5.1.3.3">5.1.3.3. <code>\ChapterDeco[<em>alignment scale</em>]{<em>text</em>}</code></h5>
<div class="d5" id="d5.1.3.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> This command is simply a way for you to remember that its content is neither the title nor subtitle of the chapter. Typical usage is to place a decorative element.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> There is a single command option, which is parsed for a letter and/or a number, with our without comma or space. The <i>alignment</i> letter is one of <i>l</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>r</i> (left, center, right). Default <i>c</i>. The numerical <i>scale</i> (may be decimal) changes the size of the text, and tweaks its vertical position. Default scale is <i>1</i>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> For your convenience, the <i>NovelDeco</i> font (included with <i>novel</i> has a few possibilities. they are accessed via the <code>\decoglyph</code> command. The list of available decorations, and codes to access them, are in the file <i>NovelDeco-glyphs.pdf</i>, which is in the <i>extras</i> folder within this documentation. Note that the decorations can be placed anywhere in your document, not just in <code>\ChapterDeco</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> <img class="floatright" src="html-resources/lowdown.png" width="300" height="141" title="chapter title with decoration" alt="chapter title with decoration"/>Most of the <code>\decoglyph</code> decorations look best when the optional <i>scale</i> is near <i>4</i>.

\vspace{2\nbs}<br/>
\ChapterTitle[l]{3}<br/>
\ChapterSubtitle[l]{The Low-Down}<br/>
\ChapterDeco[l4]{\decoglyph{n9591}\decoglyph{r9656}}<br/>
\end{ChapterStart}<br/>

<h5 id="h5.1.3.4">5.1.3.4. Chapter Epigraph</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d5.1.3.4">
<p class="noindent">If you would like to place an Epigraph within <i>ChapterStart</i>, there is no special command for that purpose. You do it the same way you would do it anywhere else: Use the <i>adjustwidth</i> environment to limit the text width. You may use the <i>parascale</i> environment to scale the block of text, without disturbing the following line grid, as long as you are within <i>ChapterStart</i>. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/bookofbeirh.png" width="344" height="191" title="chapter title with epigraph" alt="chapter title with epigraph"/><code><small>

<h4 id="h5.1.4">5.1.4. ChapterStart With Image</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.1.4">
<p class="noindent">You can use an image in chapter titles. If you place an image, use one of the image commands defined by <i>novel</i> elsewhere in the documentation. Any other method is likely to push the following text off-grid.</p>
<p>Be sure that you are licensed to use the image. Many clipart catalogs "for personal use only," prohibit usage in commercial books. One possible source is <a href="http://openclipart.org" rel="external" target="new">openclipart.org</a> (note the <em>.org</em>).</p>

<h5 id="h5.1.4.1">5.1.4.1. Text Over Image</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d5.1.4.1">
<p class="noindent"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/ctimg35.png" width="79" height="196" alt="example of chapter title image, text over"/> You may position text over an image. It is best to use black text, or grayscale text that is much darker than the underlying image. Results are uncertain if you try to place light text over a dark image, because it depends on the print technology, which is not within your control.</p>
<p>Example, where the command <code>\unifrac</code> calls for the font <i>UnifrakturMaguntia.ttf</i>. Note that the font command is <i>outside</i> \charscale:</p>
<p class="code"><code><small>\begin{ChapterStart}<br/>
\BlockImage{sword.png} <span class="ap">% centered by default</span><br/>
{\unifrak\centering\charscale[3,0pt,4\nbs]{35}\par}<br/>

</div><!-- end 5.1.4.1 -->

<h5 id="h5.1.4.2">5.1.4.2. Text Built Into Image</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d5.1.4.2">
<p class="noindent">If the text is not ordinary black, or not much darker than the background image, then it is better to include the text as part of the raster image. The reason is that "white ink" will not be used for your book. Also, you cannot use image transparency.</p>
<p>Although light text over a dark image may appear as expected in PDF, and print that way on some printers, there are many exceptions. If in doubt, ask your print service. In this example, the number is built into the image itself:</p>
<p class="code"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/smfingerprint8.png" width="86" height="70" alt="example of chapter title image, raster text"/><code><small>\begin{ChapterStart}<br/>

<h3 id="h5.2">5.2. Continuously Running Chapters</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d5.2">
<p class="noindent">Standard book design calls for each chapter to begin on a new page. However, some books are designed with numerous short chapters that run continously, so that chapters may start anywhere on a page. There are two ways to handle this in <i>novel</i>, or you can simply design your own method.</p>

<h4 id="h5.2.1">5.2.1. Reduced-Height ChapterStart</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.2.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Since the <i>ChapterStart</i> environment does not automatically begin a new page, you can use it for continuously running chapters. In Preamble, set a short height, such as <code>\SetChapterStartHeight{4}</code>. Also use <code>\SetChapterStartStyle{fancy}</code> so that headers don't disappear.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Throughout the book, you can make local adjustments to the <i>ChapterStart</i> height, so that they don't fall at an inconvenient location (such as at the bottom of a page). Yes, I have seen this done in published works. If a particular chapter is sufficiently important that it deserves a page break, or a lot more space, you can do that easily.</p>
</div><!-- end 5.2.1 -->

<h4 id="h5.2.2">5.2.2. <code>\QuickChapter[<em>linelength</em>]{<em>chapter title</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.2.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <code>\QuickChapter</code> command inserts two blank lines. In the gap, the chapter title is left-justified using <i>subch font</i> (not <i>chapter font</i>). It is slightly raised from the normal baseline, because this looks better; but the following text is back on-grid. By default, the start of the following text will be un-indented.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If the optional <i>linelength</i> is provided, then a dash will be written after the title, at the position and thickness typical of the em dash in <i>subch font</i>. If <i>linelength</i> is specified in units of length, then that will be the length of the line. But if <i>linelength</i> is an asterisk, then the line will fill to the right margin.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> This command is probably too obtrusive for mere scene changes within a chapter.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code><small>Then he looked at me with a sneer, and barked, &ldquo;You better haul your can over to Vinny's joint, before the Boss finds out.&rdquo;\par<br/>
\QuickChapter[3em]{16. At Vinny&rsquo;s}<br/>
So I took his advice, and hauled my can over to Vinny&rsquo;s. It was everything I had expected, and worse.\par<br/>
The bouncer wasn't the biggest one I&rsquo;d ever seen, but he was the ugliest. ...</small></code></p>

</div><!-- end 5.2.2 -->
</div><!-- end 5.2 -->

<h3 id="h5.3">5.3. Scene Breaks</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d5.3">
<p class="noindent">There are several commands dedicated to the purpose of scene breaks.</p>
<p class="code"><code><b>\scenebreak</b></code> inserts a one-line blank skip. The following line of text is not indented.</p>
<p class="code"><code><b>\sceneline</b></code> inserts a one-line skip, containing a short centered line. The following line of text is not indented.</p>
<p class="code"><code><b>\scenestars</b></code> inserts a one-line skip, containing three spaced, centered asterisks. The following line of text is not indented.</p>
<p style="margin-top:20px">Examples:</p>
<p class="code"><img style="float:right; margin-left:16px;" src="html-resources/scenebreaks.png" width="331" height="236" alt="scene breaks"/>
<code><small>
\noindent It was a dark and stormy night.\par<br/>
Lord Withens, the last of his line, hurried through the gloom to Castle McWhistle, where Lady McWhistle awaited.\par<br/>
\scenebreak<br/>
Well, maybe it was not very dark.\par<br/>
But to Lord Withens, it seemed dark enough. Or rather, he hoped it was dark enough. Lord McWhistle was suspicious.\par<br/>
\sceneline<br/>
Actually, it was not all that stormy, either. But the Withens clan never tolerated drizzle, much less a storm.\par<br/>
Who could blame them? It's not like they lived in Italy.\par<br/>
\scenestars<br/>
Ah, such ill fortune haunted the Withens!\par<br/>
Unfortunately, novelists of that era had so little to write about, or they would have chosen another family to pursue.\par
</small></code></p>
<p>If you are using <code>\scenebreak</code> and the gap occurs at the very bottom or top of a page, then manually substitute <code>\sceneline</code> or <code>\scenestars</code> there. This is a standard way to indicate that the gap is intentional. The substitution is not automatic.</p>

<h4 id="h5.3.1">5.3.1. <code>\SetScenebreakIndent{<em>true</em> or <em>false</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.3.1">
<p class="noindent">This global command may only be used in the Preamble. Default is <i>false</i>.</p>
<p>Normally, text begins without a paragraph indent, after each scene break. This is standard in fiction. If you prefer that each new scene begins indented, use this command. It works only with <code>\scenebreak</code>, <code>\sceneline</code>, and <code>\scenestars</code>.</p>
</div><!-- end 5.3.1 -->
</div><!-- end 5.3 -->

<h3 id="h5.4">5.4. Automatic Chapter Numbering</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d5.4">
<p class="noindent">By popular demand, here is how to add automatic chapter numbering:</p>
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Counter <i>novelcn</i> is pre-defined, and initialized to <i>1</i> (not zero). If you simply wish to print its value as a number, then increment the count, do something like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\ChapterTitle{Chapter \the\value{novelcn}\stepcounter{novelcn}}
</code></p>
<p>That will print Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and so forth. Of course, only do this for real, numbered chapters, not for "chapter-like" sections. If your book has several parts, and each part re-sets its own chapter count, use \setcounter{novelcn}{1} prior to the first chapter in each part.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you would like the number to be spelled out, as in Chapter One, Chapter Two, and so forth, then try the <i>fmtcount</i> package. It can also do ordinals such as First Chapter, Second Chapter. See the <i>fmtcount</i> package documentation for details.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If your document's language is other than English, use <code>\setdefaultlanguage</code> <i>before</i> you load the <i>fmtcount</i> package. If you do it later, then positioning will be incorrect.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> Caution: At the time I write this, <i>fmtcount</i> does not detect <i>luatex</i>. Without some hacking, it incorrectly positions its text, when used with <i>novel</i>. The maintainer has been informed. Until such time as <i>fmtcount</i> is fixed, here is the hack. In Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
% if necessary, use \setdefaultlanguage first.<br/>
\xetextrue % remove this command when <i>fmtcount</i> is fixed<br/>
\RequirePackage{fmtcount}<br/>
\xetexfalse % remove this command when <i>fmtcount</i> is fixed
</code></p>
<p>Example usage in chapter titles:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\ChapterTitle{\Ordinalstring{novelcn}\stepcounter{novelcn} Robbery} %1<br/>
\ChapterTitle{\Ordinalstring{novelcn}\stepcounter{novelcn} Robbery} %2<br/>
\ChapterTitle{\Ordinalstring{novelcn}\stepcounter{novelcn} Robbery} %3

</div><!-- end 5.4 -->

<h3 id="h5.5">5.5. First Lines and Drop Caps</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d5.5">
<p class="noindent">The first line of chapter text is often treated with a style of its own. Often, all or part of the first line is in small caps. The first letter may be larger than the rest. Or, the first letter may occupy several lines (sometimes using an image). This last effect is known as <i>drop cap</i> (French <i>lettrine</i>).</p>

<h4 id="h5.5.1">5.5.1. First Character Special</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.5.1">
<p class="noindent">Use the <code>\charscale</code> command to size the first letter (or more than one letter) so that it stands above the remainder of the line. Remember that you will see a capital letter standing next to lowercase letters, so it will appear taller. You may also use a font command. Example, where <code>\NewFontFace\alexbrush{AlexBrush-Regular.ttf}</code> appears in Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\noindent\charscale[1.6]{\alexbrush I}\hspace{0.2em}t was a dark and stormy night. Well, it really wasn't all that dark, seeing as how this story is set in Las Vegas.
</code></p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/firstletterspecial.png" width="680" height="83" alt="first letter special" title="first letter special"/></p>
</div><!-- end 5.5.1 -->

<h4 id="h5.5.2">5.5.2. First Line Small Caps</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.5.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> If you want to place a portion of the first line in small caps, then simply do it using <code>\textsc{text}</code>. This effect can also continue to additional lines. That is, it does not automatically stop at the end of the first line.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The <i>magaz</i> package is pre-loaded in <i>novel</i>. It provides the <code>\FirstLine</code> command, which takes the entire first paragraph as its argument. Place <code>\noindent</code> inside. You may also style the first letter (or more than one) as described above; the styled letter appears inside the <code>\FirstLine</code> command. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\FirstLine{\noindent\charscale[1.6]{\alexbrush I}\hspace{0.2em}t was a dark and stormy night. Well, it really wasn't all that dark, seeing as how this story is set in Las Vegas.}

<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/firstlinespecial.png" width="682" height="84" alt="first line small caps" title="first line small caps"/></p>
</div><!-- end 5.5.2 -->

<h4 id="h5.5.3">5.5.3. Drop Caps</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d5.5.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <i>drop cap</i> is an enlarged letter (or image) at the beginning of chapter text, with the first few lines of text wrapped around it:</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/dropcap.png" width="431" height="112" title="drop cap" alt="drop cap"/></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Works of popular fiction rarely use drop caps. Instead, having a special first character (<a href="#h5.5.1">section 5.5.1</a>) is more common, as it presents fewer layout problems, and is less distracting.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The <code>\dropcap</code> command is native to <i>novel</i>. You may also load and use <i>lettrine</i>. An extensive discussion of drop caps is in <a href="#hF">Appendix F</a>.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>D.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> If you expect to use the <code>\Rework</code> commands, be aware that you may need to manually adjust drop caps, because the rework algorithm is not fully effective there.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d6.1.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Standard LaTeX font size commands, such as <code>\small</code> and <code>\LARGE</code>, are disabled in <i>novel</i>. If you use them, they will be ignored, and the affected text will be printed without modification. This is by intent, for the purpose of maintaining the baseline grid.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The one exception is that <a href="#hXXXXX">footnotes</a> will appear with smaller than normal size and skip. But this is done automatically. You cannot manipulate it with a size command.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Use <i>novel's</i> own commands for manipulating font size. The correct command depends on the quantity of text involved.</p>

<h4 id="h6.1.2">6.1.2. <code>\charscale[<em>scale,hoffset,voffset</em>]{<em>text, but not image</em>}</code> and starred</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.1.2">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The contents of <code>\charscale{}</code> occupy no vertical space. Thus, scaled text does not push baselines apart. Excessive scale may cause characters to overlap; in some cases this is a desirable special effect.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The optional argument has up to three comma-separated components. The first is a number, which scales the text relative to its natural size. If the text was already scaled by some other operation (such as using <i>fontspec</i> to define the font with Scale feature), then the effect is cumulative.</p>
<p>Do not use a scale close to zero, or negative. The result is unpredictable.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> <code>\charscale</code> may be used for a short amount of text, where there is no line break, and no wrap. The command will throw an error if the included text has <code>\\</code> or <code>\par</code> or any other method that breaks the line.</p>
<p>Excessive text will not wrap. It will overflow into the right margin.</p>

\charscale[1.2]{Jack be quick, JACK} (5)\par
</small></code></p>
<p>In the above example, <code>\par</code> is not contained within <code>\charscale</code>. Line 4 is so enarged that its ascenders and descenders overlap other text.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> The second optional component, if use, is horizontal offset. The third optional component, if used, is vertical offset. Offsets are lengths, measured in units such as <code>em</code> or <code>\nbs</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> In its starred form, the contents of <code>\charscale*{}</code> occupy neither vertical nor horizontal space.</p>
<p class="code" style="margin-left:0px"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/alphabetagamma.png" width="228" height="100" title="use of \charscale" alt="use of \charscale"/><code><small>

</small></code></p>
<p>In line 1, Beta is enlarged, but not offset. It occupies slightly more width than it would have occupied unscaled. In line 2, Beta has been offset. Since the unstarred <code>\charscale</code> was used, the horizontal space is still there.</p>
<p>Line 3 has no Beta. Line 4 uses the starred <code>\charscale*</code> to offset Beta, but no width is left behind. Note that the space between Alpha and Gamma is an ordinary inter-word space, because there is a space following the command.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> <code>\charscale</code> is very effective on <a href="#h8.3.1.1">display pages</a>, where you can scale and move text however you wish. The starred version is especially useful, since back-to-back <code>\charscale*</code> will place text from a single vantage point.</p>
<p class="item"><b>G.</b> In main text, the most practical application of <code>\charscale</code> is to enlarge the first character of chapter text. See <a href="#h5.5.1">section 5.5.1</a>. Otherwise, the command is rarely used, mostly for local correction of characters that need some size adjustment.</p>

<p class="item"><b>D.</b> To restore the main line grid, when <i>parascale</i> is used within main text, wrap <i>parascale</i> in the <a href="#h6.3.2">linegap</a> environment.</p>
<p>The line gap is not automatic; you must compile, look at the result of <i>parascale</i>, then adjust the gap and re-compile. If your text is on more than one page, then you will need to use more than one <i>linegap</i>.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d6.2.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> <code>\scshape{text, may cross paragraphs}</code> is a general-purpose command for converting lowercase to small caps.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> <code>\textsc{<em>text</em>}</code> does not cross paragraphs. Alias: <code>\smcp{<em>text</em>}</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> <code>\allsmcp{<em>text</em>}</code> places both uppercase and lowercase letters in small caps. It does not cross paragraphs.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Small caps are taken from the font's <i>smcp</i> Open Type feature. If the font is not Open Type, or does not have this feature, then small caps will not be faked. Command <code>\allsmcp</code> also uses feature <i>c2sc</i> if it is available; otherwise it converts letters to lowercase, then applies <i>smcp</i>.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>E.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> If you require small caps, but your font does not have them, you can fake them by scaling uppercase. But this is usually unattractive. A better method is described in the <i>fontspec</i> package documentation: You may appoint a different font that will provide small caps.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>F.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> If you insist on using old-fashioned TeX fonts, which do not have the <i>smcp</i> Open Type feature, then you may need to write this code in the Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\let\smcp\oldscshape\relax<br/>
\let\textsc\oldscshape\relax<br/>
\let\scshape\oldscshape\relax</code></p>
<p>The above code sends you in a time machine back to the Twentieth Century.</p>
<p class="item"><b>G.</b> <code>\acronym{<em>text</em>}</code> is special to <i>novel</i>. If the <i>NovelDeco</i> font is installed, uppercase letters in the text will be converted to "mid-size capitals," and lowercase will remain lowercase, but with ascenders slightly reduced. The purpose of this command is so that acronyms such as NASA and NATO blend well with surrounding text. I have found that whereas ordinary uppercase is too conspicuous, small caps also looks wrong. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/acronym2.png" width="192" height="89" alt="acronym"/>
<code>
The NATO alliance...\par<br/>
The \acronym{NATO} alliance...\par<br/>
The \allsmcp{NATO} alliance...\par
</code></p>
<p>Whether or not to use the \acronym command, is up to you. Since its letters are drawn from the <i>NovelDeco</i> font, rather than your main font, there may be some stylistic differences if your <i>parent font</i> is not Libertinus&nbsp;Serif.</p>

<h4 id="h6.2.5">6.2.5. Local Tracking Adjustment</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.2.5">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> <i>Tracking</i> refers to how tight or loose is the space between adjacent letters. This is a property of the font itself, and is automatically tweaked by the included <i>microtype</i> package. Do not confuse tracking with <i>inter-word spacing</i>, which is more widely adjusted during paragraph layout calculations.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If only two adjacent letters are involved, use the <code>\kern</code> or <code>\hspace</code> command. The following examples have the same effect. Note that there is no added space character, and that the units of length are <code>em</code>:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
I\kern-.05emt was a dark and stormy night.<br/>
I\hspace{-.05em}t was a dark and stormy night.
</code></p> 
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Loose tracking is often used in page header text. In <i>novel</i>, this is addressed by a special command. See <a href="#h4.3.4.3">section 4.3.4.3</a>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Do not use the <code>\textls</code> command. It will be ignored, and its contents will be rendered with ordinary tracking.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> The included <i>fontspec</i> package allows you to globally set the tracking of an Open Type font, or locally change its tracking, using the <i>LetterSpace</i> feature. It is unlikely that you will need this capability. If you do, see <i>fontspec</i> package documentation 6.8.</p>
<p class="item" style="position:relative"><b>F.</b> <img src="html-resources/info18.png" width="18" height="18" style="position:relative; bottom:-3px" title="tech info" alt="tech info"/> There are two <i>novel</i>-specific commands that are "for emergency use only." <code>\squeeze{<em>text</em>}</code> narrows the text by one percent. <code>\crush{<em>text</em>}</code> narrows the text by two percent.</p>
<p>These commands use <i>microtype</i> to temporarily apply a horizontal scale to the letters. Inter-word spacing is not necessarily changed (it can even grow larger), because spacing is calculated during paragraph layout. The enclosed text may span paragraphs.</p>
<p>The commands do not compound. That is, placing one crush inside another will not narrow the text by four percent.</p>
<p>The only application for these commands is when a paragraph does not quite fit where you would like it to be. For example: Perhaps one short word, or part of a word, dangles to an extra line. Try <code>\squeeze</code> first, then <code>\crush</code>, for all or most of the paragraph. These do not always produce a useful effect, since the actual paragraph layout depends on other factors. But <em>if you are lucky,</em> then the paragraph re-flows to a better layout.</p>
<p>If the commands do not help, then <em>be sure to remove them</em>, or the typography will be worse than it was before!</p>

<h4 id="h6.2.6">6.2.6. Local Font Selection</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.2.6">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The following font commands are pre-defined in <i>novel</i>: \rmfamily (alias <a href="#h4.2.2">\mainfont</a>) <a href="#h4.2.4">\sffamily</a> <a href="#h4.2.4">\ttfamily</a> <a href="#h5.1.3.1">\chapterfont</a> <a href="#h5.1.3.1">\subchfont</a> <a href="#h4.3.4.2">\headfont</a> <a href="#h4.2.3">\decofont</a> <a href="#hF.4">\decodropcapfont</a>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Although most of the pre-defined font commands are automatically applied in specific situations, you may apply any of them yourself, in any location, using this syntax:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\subchfont This text will be in the subch font.}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> If you wish, use <i>fontspec</i> syntax to create additional font selection commands. See <a href="#h4.2.5">section 4.2.5</a> and <a href="#hE">Appendix E</a> for the essentials. For example, if you have the licensed font, this code would define the font selection command <code>\agarp</code> in Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\NewFontFamily\agarp[Numbers=OldStyle,Ligatures=Common]{Adobe Garamond Pro}</code></p>
<p>Then you would apply it to text:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\agarp Text to appear in that font.}</code></p>

<h4 id="h6.2.7">6.2.7. Local Feature Changes</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.2.7">
<p class="noindent"><code><b>{\addfontfeature{<em>feature</em>} <em>text</em>}</b></code> for changing Open Type features.</p>
<p>If a font is already defined, you can locally add one or more <a href="#hE.2">features</a>. For example, suppose that you defined <code>\mynewfont</code> without using its Open Type feature <i>ss03</i> (we will assume that the font actually has this feature). In a particular place, you wish to activate <i>ss03</i>. The code looks like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\mynewfont\addfontfeature{RawFeature=+ss03} <em>text</em>}</code> % Note + sign. Braces outside.</p>
<p>That limits the scope of the feature to the included group, in TeX terminology.</p>
<p>You can modify features used by any defined font, whether you defined it yourself or it is one of the <i>novel</i> built-in font commands. You can add more than one feature. If the requested feature does not exist in the font, then your request will be ignored.</p>
<p>What about removing a feature that is already present in the font definition? Suppose you defined <code>\mynewfont</code> so that <i>Numbers=OldStyle</i> is used. On a local basis, can you change the style of numbers? Usually, yes. You could use <i>Numbers=Lining</i> to over-ride the feature. Sometimes it depends on how you chose the features, as a matter of syntax. See the <i>fontspec</i> documentation.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d6.2.8">
<p class="noindent">For this effect, the <a href="#h2.2"><i>graytext</i></a> class option must be used, or any color command will be ignored, and its included text will be rendered in black (even if the requested color is white). Images are unaffected.</p>
<p><code><b>\color{<em>name</em>}</b></code> or <code><b>\color[gray]{<em>scale</em>}</b></code> is used within a group. All text will be in grayscale, from where the command is placed, until the group ends. If the command is not at the beginning of the group, it does not affect prior text. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>

\textcolor[gray]{0.32}{This text is in 32 percent gray.}</code></p>
<p style="margin-top:10px">Whether you use <code>\color</code> or <code>\textcolor</code>, there are two ways to specify the color: by name, or by scale, using package <i>xcolor</i> syntax.</p>
<p>&bull; The following color names are accepted, and will be converted to some shade of gray (from dark to light): black, blue, violet, darkgray, purple, red, teal, olive, magenta, gray, brown, green, orange, cyan, lightgray, lime, pink, yellow, white.</p>
<p>The above names are often not helpful, so <i>novel</i> also allows you to use these: black, gray1, gray2, gray3, gray4, gray5, gray6, gray7, gray8, gray9, white. The scale is not uniform (gray5 is not 50 percent gray), but the values are usefully spaced.</p>
<p>Other names "known to dvips," such as <i>Apricot</i>, do not work. An error will result.</p>
<p>&bull; To specify color by scale, follow the color command with <i>[gray]{<em>scale</em>}</i>, where the scale is a number between 0 (black) and 1 (white). Example:<code> \color[gray]{0.63}</code>.</p>

<div class="d3" id="d6.3">
<p class="noindent">By now, you already know: In <i>novel</i> there are new ways to position or align text, and some of the standard TeX methods are discouraged or disabled.</p>

<h4 id="h6.3.1">6.3.1. What to Avoid</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.3.1">
<p class="noindent">&bull; The <code>\raisebox</code> command does not play well with novel. It can be used, but there is the great risk of disturbing the line grid. Use <code><a href="#h6.1.2">\charscale</a></code> instead.</p>
<p>&bull; If you must use the <code>\vspace</code> command (or its relative, <code>\vskip</code>) be sure to measure the space in units of <code>\nbs</code> (normal baseline skip).</p>
<p>&bull; Avoid the <i>minipage</i> and <i>parbox</i> environments. These are likely to disrupt the line grid. When that happens, restoring the grid is your own responsibility. You may find the <i>adjustwidth</i> and <i>linegap</i> environments to be useful, as described in the next section.</p>
<p>&bull; In most cases, do not use the center environment. You may use <code>{\centering ... \par}</code> instead, for a single paragraph. The center environment may cause the text to go off-grid. That's not a problem on some stand-alone pages where you don't care about the grid, but it is ugly in the middle of running text.</p>
<p>&bull; Avoid positioning via the <i>textblock</i> or <i>textblock*</i> environments (package <i>textpos</i>). Actually, <i>novel</i> uses that code internally. But if not handled with more care than usual, positioned text can disrupt the baseline and position of surrounding text. You may use <code><a href="#h6.1.2">\charscale</a></code> to position small amounts of text safely, but not on a paragraph basis. Images have built-in positioning arguments, which may also be useful for positioned text.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not use floats. If you try, then <i>novel</i> may intercept them with a nasty message.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not use tables. Nasty message will result. But <i>novel</i> has its <a href="#h8.3.2.7">own provision</a> for a Table of Contents, and the code may be used for other purposes as well.</p>
<p>&bull; If you use images, then use only the image commands provided by novel: <code><a href="#h7.3.2">\InlineImage</a></code> and <code><a href="#h7.3.4">\BlockImage</a></code>.<p>
<p>&bull; There is no built-in provision for a two-column environment. However, you can place text <a href="#h7.3.5">alongside</a> an image.</p>
</div><!-- end 6.3.1 -->

<h4 id="h6.3.2">6.3.2. Some Useful Commands</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.3.2">
<p class="noindent">This is not a complete list. It merely addresses a few situations that you are likely to encounter, without the need for elaborate code, and without loading additional packages.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\begin{adjustwidth}{<em>left</em>}{<em>right</em>} ... \end{adjustwidth}</code></p>
<p>This environment, from the included <i>changepage</i> package, is the most useful way to create block indents. The included text may have multiple paragraphs and span pages. The left and right arguments are lengths, being the amount to <em>increase</em> the respective margins from their normal values.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\begin{linegap}{<em>integer</em>} ... \end{linegap}</code></p>
<p>This environment creates a gap of <i>integer</i> lines. Then, the following text will be on-grid, regardless of what you place inside the environment. If the contents are small relative to the gap, there will be a lot of white space. If the contents are too large, then they will overflow the gap and overlap the following text, rather than push it down.</p>
<p>This environment is particularly useful when it contains highly styled text, because you don't have to calculate a <code>\vspace</code> to restore the following line grid. Pick a likely gap, then make it larger or smaller as desired.</p>
<p>The environment fails if it crosses a page boundary. There will be no error, merely an undesired result. Be sure to plan your writing so that the linegap remains on a single page.</p>
<p>If you use a non-integer linegap, it will be processed that way, but there will be a warning in the log file. The only reason it is not an error, is that a non-integer linegap might be useful on some display pages.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\rotatebox{<em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p>This command is from the included <i>graphicx</i> package. It rotates the text, about an axis at the lower left of the text. If you wish to rotate the text about its center, use <code>\rotatebox[origin=c]{text}</code>.</p>
<p>This command plays nicely with <code>\charscale</code>, so you can size, rotate, and displace a string of text (single line). It makes a difference which command goes inside the other. More likely than not, the effect you want is obtained by using <code>\charscale</code> on the outside, with <code>\rotatebox</code> inside.</p>
<p>To avoid disturbing the line grid, <code>\rotatebox</code> is best used inside the <i>linegap</i> environment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\phantom{<em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p>Does not print the text, but leaves a horizontal gap as if the text were there.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\mbox{<em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p>Prevents a specific word from being hyphenated, or to ensure that two consecitive words always appear on the same line. The box will not be broken across lines. However, it may overhang the margin, which is undesirable.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\makebox[<em>width</em>][<em>alignment</em>]{<em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p>Puts the text in a box of fixed width (usually much larger than the text's own width) and aligns it left, center, or right in the box. If using this across the full textwidth, be sure to precede it with <code>\noindent</code> to prevent offset.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\hspace{<em>length</em>}</code></p>
<p>Creates a horizontal space.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\strut</code></p>
<p>Places an invisible box with no width, which has the height and depth of the font. Sometimes used as a placeholder.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\stake</code></p>
<p>Placeholder like <code>\strut</code>, but does not occupy the height or depth of the font.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\indent</code>, <code>\noindent</code>, <code>\forceindent</code>, <code>\backindent</code></p>
<p>Commands <code>\indent</code> and <code>\noindent</code> have their ordinary TeX meaning. Sometimes, the action of other macros will remove an indent that should be there, or add an indent that should not be there. If writing <code>\indent</code> and <code>\noindent</code> do not fix the problems, use <code>\forceindent</code> and <code>\backindent</code> as more forceful solutions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\hfill</code></p>
<p>Pushes the following text to the right end of the line. Actual effect depends on what precedes and follows. Sometimes a \strut is needed at the beginning of a line.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\vfill</code>, <code>\vfill*</code></p>
<p>Pushes the following text to the bottom of the page. Actual effect depends on paragraph organization. Use the asterisk if there is nothing printed above this command, on the same page.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\kern</code></p>
<p>Tweaks the spacing between consecutive letters. A tricky command, as it is always used without braces, and makes the surrounding text illegible in your source code. If you use it, the units of length should always be <i>em</i>, rather than <i>pt</i>. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>It wa\kern-.02ems a da\kern.03emrk and stormy ni\kern-.004emght.</code></p>
<p>The <code>\kern</code> command is not useful for globally changing kern values.</p>
<p id="bigemdash" style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\bigemdash[<em>yoffset,thickness</em>]</code></p>
<p>Simulates a "big emdash" of variable length. Horizontal width is from command to end of line marked by <code>\par</code>, or limited by a fixed width such as created by <code>\makebox</code>. If placed in other situations, the line may be missing or too long.</p>
<p>The line's normal position is at the typical height of an emdash, which is slightly above half the height of lowercase x. Its normal width is typical of an emdash width. Thus, the line is like an extended emdash.</p>
<p>You can tweak the line using its optional argument. The first value tweaks the vertical position by a scale factor, where 1 equals its normal position (so that 0.9 places it a little lower). The second argument, if used, is separated from the first by a comma. It tweaks the line thickness by a scale factor (so that 0.9 makes it a little thinner).</p>
<p>Since <code>\bigemdash</code> allows an optional argument, but no mandatory argument, you may not immediately follow it with text. If it is boxed, then first close the box; otherwise, end the paragraph.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10pt"><code>\straightquote</code>, <code>\straightdblquote</code></p>
<p>These insert the single quote (apostrophe), and double quote, as ASCII straight characters. Prevents TeX (or your software) from automatically substituting the curly characters.</p>

<h3 id="h6.4">6.4 Superscripts, Subscripts</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d6,4">
<p class="noindent">In <i>novel</i>, superscripts and subscripts are called "markers." Most book-quality Open Type fonts have markers in style sets (<i>sups</i>, <i>sinf</i>, <i>subs</i>).</p>
<p>In professional fonts, marker glyph weights are adjusted for consistent appearance compared to ordinary glyphs. However, many free fonts do not adjust marker glyph weights, so the markers may appear too small, or too light. You may choose whether to use a font's own markers, or allow <i>novel</i> to generate markers, depending on whichever you think looks better.</p>
<p>&bull; <i>real</i> markers attempt to use the Open Type feature <i>sups</i> for superscripts, and the feature <i>sinf</i> (preferred) or <i>subs</i> (alternate) for subscripts. If the requested feature is not available for the font, then it will be automatically faked, by scaling/raising/lowering ordinary characters from the basefont (lining numerals will be used).</p>
<p>&bull; <i>fake</i> markers ignore whether the Open Type features are available, and simply fakes them.</p>

<h4 id="h6.4.1">6.4.1 <code>\SetMarkerStyle[<em>real,fake</em>]{<em>asterisk, dagger, number</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.4.1">
<p>This command may only be used in the Preamble. It globally sets the kind of marker to be used. Default is <i>real</i> and <i>asterisk</i>.</p>
<p>The optional argument applies real or fake markers, as described above.</p>
<p>The required argument applies only to markers created by the <code>\footnote</code> command. It does not apply to endnotes, or to manually placed superscripts and subscripts.</p>
<p>&bull; <i>asterisk</i> (default) uses symbolic footnote markers. The symbols rotate in order * † ‡ § ** †† ‡‡ §§ until reset.</p>
<p>&bull; <i>dagger</i> uses symbolic footnote markers, but without asterisks. The symbols rotate in order † ‡ § †† ‡‡ §§ until reset.</p>
<p>&bull; <i>number</i> uses numerical footnote markers. Due to possible conflict, the log file will have a "Big Bad Warning" if you use a numerical footnote marker in a document that also has endnotes, since endnotes always have numerical markers.</p>
</div><!-- end 6.4.1 -->

<h4 id="h6.4.2">6.4.2 <code>\realmarker</code>, <code>\fakemarker</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.4.2">
<p class="noindent">Within the body of the document, you may use <code>\realmarker</code> and <code>\fakemarker</code> to change your preference. The choice remains in effect until you change it again.</p>
<p>The option real/fake applies wherever superscripts or subscripts are used, not just for footnotes or endnotes.</p>
</div><!-- end 6.4.2 -->
</div><!-- end 6.4 -->

<h3 id="h6.5">6.5. Footnotes and Endnotes</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d6.5">
<p class="noindent">The <i>novel</i> class has <em>limited</em> support for footnotes, because they are rarely used in fiction. Nevertheless, I have seen them. The notes may be factual or imaginary.</p>
<p>If there are more than a handful of notes, then use endnotes to avoid a constant disruption of the text flow. You may use both footnotes and endnotes.</p>
<p>Footnotes and endnotes insert superscripts (markers) at the appropriate point in the main text. The actual footnote or endnote begins with the marker in ordinary text, not as a superscript.</p>

<h4 id="h6.5.1">6.5.1 Footnotes</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.5.1">
<p>Footnotes appear at the bottom of the page where they are placed. There is no option to accumulate them to another location. Very long footnotes might straddle pages, but that situation is uncommon in fiction (and not within your control).</p>
<p class="code"><code>\footnote[<em>option</em>]{<em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p>The <code>\footnote</code> command places a superscript "marker" at the place where the command is written. The included text is written at the bottom of the page, beneath a short line that separates it from the main text. The footnote text is at smaller size and line skip, and has the same marker placed before it (but not as superscript). All of this is automatic.</p>
<p>You may, if necessary, apply some style to the footnote text. For example, if you are referring to another work, its title might be in italics.</p>
<p>Normally, no option is used. If you use option <i>0</i> (zero) then no marker will appear in the main text, and the footnote text will also appear without a marker. The count of markers is not incremented. This applies whether the markers are numbers or symbols.</p>
<p>&bull; Trick: If you are using footnote numbers, but wish to place a special footnote using a symbol, you can do it manually. For example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>He blinked.*\footnote[0]{* No, he didn't.}</code></p>
<p>&bull; Avoid use of underlining, as it is considered bad style, due to visual distraction. If necessary, use italics.</p>
</div><!-- end 6.5.1 -->

<h4 id="h6.5.2">6.5.2 Endnotes</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d6.5.2">
<p class="noindent">Endnotes are sometimes used in fiction. In general, the endnotes are also fictional.</p>
<p>You may use both footnotes and endnotes, if you wish. However, if endnotes are used, then footnotes must be marked by symbols, rather than by numbers, to avoid confusion. The counts for endnotes and footnotes are independent.</p>

<h5 id="h6.5.2.1">6.5.2.1 <code>\endnote</code>, <code>\ResetEndnote</code>, <code>\memo{}</code></h5>
<div class="d5" id="d6.5.2.1">
<p class="noindent">The <code>\endnote</code> command inserts a numerical superscript in the text. A running count of the numbers is automatically updated. This command does nothing else.</p>
<p>The endnote numbers normally run continuously through the text, without reset. If you wish to reset the count (perhaps at new chapters), you have to do it manually, using <code>\ResetEndnote</code> at the appropriate location.</p>
<p>Since <code>\endnote</code> gobbles any following space, use <code>\endnote{}</code> to preserve the space.</p>
<p>When you use <code>\endnote</code>, there is no provision for the actual note, at that place in the text. The <i>novel</i> class does not know, and does not care, whether or not you actually write the endnote later.</p>
<p>If you wish to write an in-place reminder to yourself, about why you put an endnote marker there, use <code>\memo{<i>text</i>}</code>. The argument of <code>\memo</code> will not be printed, and will not be remembered for later use. Note that <code>\memo</code> is not like the percent <code>%</code> comment, because anything following <code>\memo</code> will be honored. Also, don't use space both before and after <code>\memo{}</code>, because both spaces will appear when typeset:</p>
<p class="code"><i>Wrong:</i> <code>... in the sacred book.\endnote \memo{Dorf, VI} Afterward, Shange left for ...</code><br/>
<i>Correct:</i> <code>... in the sacred book.\endnote\memo{Dorf, VI} Afterward, Shange left for ...</code></p>
</div><!-- end 6.5.2.1 -->

<h5 id="h6.5.2.2">6.5.2.2 <code>\endnotetext{<em>number</em>}{<em>text</em>}</code></h5>
<div class="d5" id="d6.5.2.2">
<p class="noindent">The <code>\endnotetext</code> command is a simple way of styling endnotes. You do not have to use it, if you have your own method. These may be placed per-chapter, or at the final end. The <i>novel</i> class does not keep track of them.</p>
<p>The first argument is usually the endnote number. A period and following space will automatically be added, so that the text of the note is block-indented. You may use <code>\emph{<em>number</em>}</code> if you prefer the number to be in italics.</p>
<p>The text must be one paragraph. Be sure to end with <code>\par</code> or equivalent.</p>
<p>If the note needs more than one paragraph, then continue like this, with an empty note number:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\endnotetext{}{\indent <em>text</em>}</code></p>
<p>&bull; In <i>novel</i>, you must create and style the page(s) with endnotes yourself! There is no provision for bibliography, and no provision for any other kind of automated styling. This is because the endnotes, being fictional, are more like the main text than any academic style. Think of the endnotes as just another chapter, but starting with something that identifies them as being endnotes. Pagination continues as main matter, with Arabic page numbers. This is recommended by <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i>, for both fiction and nonfiction.</p>
<p>&bull; There is no track of which endnote number was placed where. You will have to keep track of them yourself. In the following example, the author knows that the endnote numbers are <i>9</i> and <i>10</i>, only after an initial typesetting run showed the numbers. Then, the endnote texts were added.</p>
<p>Example of an endnote:</p>
<p class="code">
<code><small>
\endnotetext{9}{Yang Sho-Nuff was the twelfth son of the elder god of the ancient Who-Zit Clan, with power over the forces of rust.\par}<br/>
\endnotetext{}{\indent However, since this was not yet the Iron Age, the terrible might of Yang Sho-Nuff was largely unrecognized.\par}<br/>
\endnotetext{10}{As Professor Withens notes in his treatise, \emph{When Sho-Nuff Was Not Enough}, the ceremony of daily human sacrifice had a devastating effect on the tribal population.\par}

<h2 id="h7">7. Interior B/W or Gray Images, and Color Cover Artwork</h2>
<div class="d2" id="d7">
<p class="noindent">If you intend to place a lot of images in your document, or if you need to have text wrap around floating images, then the <i>novel</i> document class is not well-suited to your purpose. This is because the methods of formatting, and the emphasis on maintaining a constant baseline skip, sometimes interfere with the behavior you expect from other document classes.</p>
<p>Yet you can place the occasional image. Most fiction does use imagery on the title page, and sometimes at chapter starts. Some stories include a map, or an image of ancient writing. In a detective novel, we might get a glimpse at handwritten evidence. The <i>novel</i> class has its own commands for easily dealing with these situations.</p>

<h3 id="h7.1">7.1. Raster Images Only</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d7.1">
<p class="noindent">You may place only raster images in your document. No vector artwork. No included <i>eps</i> or <i>pdf</i>. Forget about <i>pgf</i> and <i>TikZ</i>. Although you can "cheat" the <i>novel</i> commands, and circumvent these restrictions, <em>don't do it</em>. These restrictions are intentional.</p>
<p>You may think that the above paragraph is a mistake. Haven't you been told that vector artwork is always preferable to rasterized artwork, because vector artwork is scalable? The part about being scalable is true. But if you do not need scalability, vector artwork is worse.</p>
<p>How so? A PDF file can incorporate vector artwork, and if properly done it will meet commercial printing standards. <em>Sadly, it is often not properly done.</em> When vector artwork has technical errors, as it often does, then the appearance will depend on which software is used to view the image. The fact that it is within a PDF does not always help.</p>
<p>Also, commercial standards don't like vector artwork where bleed is emulated using control points beyond the MediaBox. You don't know what that statement means, do you? That's another reason to avoid vector artwork.</p>
<p>When you design a vector image, or perhaps acquire one, you approve its appearance based on what you see on your computer. The odds are good that a friend or editor, on a different computer, will be using the same software and thus see the same result. However, that is not true of the software built into commercial printing machines. That software may interpret erroneous or ambiguous vector instructions in a different way than you expected.</p>
<p>A good example is on pages 232-234 of the <i>Adobe PDF 1.7 Reference</i>. That's an enormous file, full of technical information. You don't need to read it. But Adobe provides an example of a vector drawing in the form of a five-pointed star, made with one continuous line that crosses itself. There are two possible rules for deciding whether the central pentagon should be filled or not. They produce different results. Adobe chooses a particular rule, and so should all compliant software. But is all software compliant? Without reading the Adobe spec, there is no particular reason to prefer one rule over the other. And, that's a simple example. Many vector drawings are very convoluted, in ways that make the artist's intent difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>You normally do not need to scale images. Your finished work will be viewed at fixed size on the printed page, not at variable size in a PDF reader. So, <em>scalability is not an advantage</em>. Your image is placed on paper at its exact size and resolution. You are in complete control. If it is purely black/white line art, its detail will be about the same whether it was placed as vector or raster. If it is grayscale, it is subject to halftoning, which reduces the resolution in any case.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not attempt to place an image by including a PDF within your TeX file. The reason is that the included PDF may carry its own File Data, which will differ from the File Data of the main PDF. There's nothing you can do about that, and commercial printers don't like it. So, don't do it. Indeed, <i>novel</i> may ban it!</p>

<h4 id="h7.1.1">7.1.1. Use Flattened <i>png</i> or <i>jpg</i> Image Format</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.1.1">
<p class="noindent">The <i>novel</i> image-handling commands require the <i>png</i> or <i>jpg</i> formats, exclusively. If you already have a raster image in another format, such as <i>tif</i>, you must convert it. If you have a vector image, such as <i>eps</i> or <i>svg</i> format, you must rasterize it. This must all be done in an external graphics program, such as <i>GIMP</i> or <i>Inkscape</i>. It cannot be done from within TeX.</p>
<p>Both <i>jpg</i> and <i>png</i> images can store their resolution internally. When you export images from a graphics program, be sure that the resolution is stored. This may or may not be an option that you need to check, in an export dialog box.</p>
<p>Be sure to flatten the image before you export it to <i>png</i>. With <i>jpg</i>, the exported image is always flattened.</p>
<p>When using grayscale, be sure to convert the image to <i>only grayscale</i>, which has only one color channel. In GIMP, this is achieved with the <i>Image&gt;Mode</i> menu. Note that an RGB or CMYK image "that only uses grays" is <em>not</em> the same thing, since these have three or four color channels!</p>
<p>When using pure black/white (<i>png</i> only), you can get there with GIMP's <i>Image&gt;Mode&gt;Indexed</i> menu.</p>
<p>Note that within the finished PDF file, images are stored in an internal format which differs from your input. If your image is in the wrong format, or contains transparency, it will not be detected by TeX.</p>
</div><!-- end 7.1.1 -->

<h4 id="h7.1.2">7.1.2. Saving the Resolution</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.1.2">
<p class="noindent">Image resolution is measured in dots per inch (dpi). In a graphics program, it may be called pixels per inch (ppi). And, if the software was written in Europe or Asia, it may be measured in pixels per centimetre!</p>
<p>When you prepare an image in a graphics program, you must first ensure that it is at the correct resolution. Most U.S. print services require <i>300dpi</i> for grayscale images (or color covers), <i>600dpi</i> for black/white line art. Then, it is a simple matter of multiplying the image dimensions (in inches) by the resolution, to get the image dimensions in pixels.</p>
<p>Example: A grayscale image that will print at 1.25" wide by 1.5" high, must be 375 pixels wide by 450 pixels high, at 300dpi. If the original image is at different dimensions, it must be cropped and scaled to the correct size. However, it is not enough to finish the image at 375x450 pixels. You must specifically set the resolution to 300dpi. If you fail to set the resolution correctly, then the image will not appear at its correct size in your PDF.</p>
<p>In GIMP, you can use the <i>Image&gt;Scale&nbsp;Image</i> dialog box to ensure that the image is at the proper size and resolution. When you change any of the settings, others may change in response. Be sure that all settings are satisfactory.</p>
<p>When you export your image, you may be asked whether or not to save the resolution. Be sure to save it.</p>
<p>Example dialog boxes for grayscale png exported from GIMP:</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/imgdialogs.png" width="600" height="192" alt="png image with resolution"/></p>
</div><!-- end 7.1.2 -->

<h4 id="h7.1.3">7.1.3. Removing Private Metadata</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.1.3">
<p class="noindent">Your image may contain "private metadata" that records how the image was created, especially if it was converted from a digital photograph. For example, EXIF and IPTC may contain a lot of private metadata. The image may also contain color profile data that is inappropriate for a grayscale or black/white image.</p>
<p>Many commercial printing standards require that such private metadata be removed from images. The PDF File Data should speak for everything, not the individual images.</p>
<p>The simplest way to remove private metadata is via a command-line program: Use either <i>ImageMagick</i>, or <i>GraphicsMagick</i>. These programs work on Windows, Linux, and (so I am told) OS/X. Specific code is shown in the workflow examples, below. If you ever re-work an image, you must once again remove its private metadata.</p>
</div><!-- end 7.1.3 -->
</div><!-- end 7.1 -->

<h3 id="h7.2">7.2. Workflows for Interior Line Art and Grayscale</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d7.2">
<p class="noindent">Two kinds of images may appear in a black-and-white book: <i>line art</i>, and <i>grayscale</i>.</p>
<p>Line art contains only black and white. Moreover, there cannot be any places where the black or white areas are very tiny, so you cannot emulate gray by dithering black/white.</p>
<p>Most print services request that line art be rasterized at 600dpi (dots per inch), and that grayscale images be rasterized at 300dpi. Grayscale images may be printed using halftone technology. Text that sits atop a halftoned image may itself be halftoned.</p>

<h4 id="h7.2.1">7.2.1. Workflow: Line Art in GIMP</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.2.1">
<p class="noindent">To create a suitable <b>line art</b> image in GIMP, with post-processing in ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick, follow these instructions:</p>
<p>(1) Open the image file in GIMP. If it is a vector format (such as svg or pdf), ensure that it is resolved to 600&nbsp;pixels/in with anti-aliasing, and that its size is the same as your intended dimensions (measured in inches or mm). You can also use a larger size, if you intend to crop some of the periphery; or you can use a smaller size, if you intend to make it larger by adding white space.</p>
<p>(2) If you need to crop to a smaller size, or add to a larger size, do it now. <i>Image>Canvas&nbsp;Size</i>, with <i>Resize&nbsp;Layers:All</i>.</p>
<p>(3) If you need to edit the image, by adding or removing anything, do it now.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Image&gt;Flatten&nbsp;Image</i>.</p>
<p>(5) <i>Image&gt;Mode&gt;Grayscale</i>.</p>
<p>(6) <i>View&gt;Zoom</i> to an appropriate amount that shows the image at approximately its print size. That depends on your monitor's resolution. On my own computer, 25% is about right. Does not need to be exact.</p>
<p>(7) <i>Colors&gt;Threshold</i>. If necessary, adjust the slider until the image looks best. It might be that the default 50% works for you. If you move it to the left, then black areas will become a little narrower. If to the right, black areas will become a little thicker.</p>
<p>(8) <i>Image&gt;Mode&gt;Indexed&gt;(black&nbsp;and&nbsp;white,&nbsp;1-bit&nbsp;palette)</i>. Remove unused colors from colormap. No dithering.</p>
<p>(9) <i>File&gt;Export</i>. Use png (Portable Network Graphics) extension. When the dialog box appears, ensure that "save resolution" is checked. Use the highest level of compression offered. The exported image may look poor in some image viewers, because those viewers do not read the full resolution. Not a problem. The image will look good when seen in better viewers.</p>
<p>(10) Command-Line Terminal, using GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick:</p>
<p class="code">GraphicsMagick, Windows or Linux: <code>gm mogrify -strip nameofimage.png</code></p>
<p class="code">ImageMagick, Windows: <code>magick mogrify -strip nameofimage.png</code></p>
<p class="code">ImageMagick, Linux: <code>mogrify -strip nameofimage.png</code></p>
<p>(11) Sanity check:</p>
<p class="code">GraphicsMagick, Windows or Linux: <code>gm identify -verbose nameofimage.png</code></p>
<p class="code">ImageMagick, Windows: <code>magick identify -verbose nameofimage.png</code></p>
<p class="code">ImageMagick, Linux: <code>identify -verbose nameofimage.png</code></p>
<p>After a few moments, the Terminal will show some information. It should say that the depth is 1-bits per pixel, that the only color is gray (1&nbsp;bits),  that the resolution is 236.22 pixels per centimeter (which is 600dpi). The page geometry, divided by 600, will give you the image size in inches (thus, a page geometry of 900+1200+0+0 represents an image 1.5" wide x 2" high).</p>
</div><!-- end 7.2.1 -->

<h4 id="h7.2.2">7.2.2. Workflow: Grayscale in GIMP</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.2.2">

GIMP's <i>Colors&gt;Levels</i> might be more useful than <i>Colors&gt;Brightness/Contrast</i>.</p>
<p>(8) Ensure that white areas are truly white, not light gray. Use GIMP's <i>Select&nbsp;By&nbsp;Color</i> Tool, with a very low threshold, to choose areas that should be exactly white, then clear them.</p>
<p>(9) <i>File&gt;Export</i>. Use png (Portable Network Graphics) extension. When the dialog box appears, ensure that "save resolution" is checked. Use the highest level of compression offered.

<p>After a few moments, the Terminal will show some information. It should say that the type is grayscale, at 8 bits per pixel. The resolution is 118.11 pixels per centimeter (which is 300dpi). The page geometry, divided by 300, will give you the image size in inches (thus, a page geometry of 900+1200+0+0 represents an image 3" wide x 4" high).</p>
<p class="floatright"><img src="html-resources/pngcolortype.png" width="270" height="46" alt="png color type"/><br/><img src="html-resources/jpgcolorspace.png" width="296" height="46" alt="jpg colorspace"/></p>
<p>Most important of all: Scroll through the information. Near its end, you should see a line like this. The exact wording will depend on your software:</p>
<p class="code" style="clear:both">For png images: &nbsp; <i>png: IHDR.color_type: 0 (grayscale)</i></p>
<p class="code">For jpg images: &nbsp; <i>JPEG-Colorspace: 1</i> and <i>JPEG-Colorspace-Name: GRAYSCALE</i></p>
<p>The above codes are the only ones that matter. Even if other information claims that the image is grayscale, or lists the colors and they are all shades of gray, <em>that is not good enough</em>. When automated software reviews your PDF for compliance, it will look at the png <i>IHDR.color_type</i>, which must be 0, or the <i>JPEG-Colorspace</i>, which must be 1. Anything else fails. If the information is different, it means that you forget to change the mode from RGB to grayscale before you exported the image.</p>
<p>You may ask: If the image was not really grayscale, can it be converted to grayscale using a simple command line, with ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick? The answer is yes, but don't do it that way. The reason is that there are many ways to map colors (even "gray colors") to true grayscale, and an automated conversion may produce unexpectedly light or dark results. It is better to do the conversion in a graphics program, where you can see what you are doing.</p>

<div class="d4" id="d7.2.3">
<p class="noindent">When you use one or both of the <code>\Rework</code> commands (<a href="#hA">Appendix A</a>), the font size and/or the baselineskip will change. However, it does not scale images. In many cases, there is no problem. But in some cases, an un-scaled image will disrupt the previous flow of text or pagination. The same Appendix shows you how to scale images when you use <code>\Rework</code>.</p>

<h3 id="h7.3">7.3. Placing Images In Your Document</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d7.3">
<p class="noindent">An image may be placed as an inline element, using the <code>\InlineImage</code> or <code>\InlineImage*</code> command. This allows the image to mingle with text, and even have text as an overlay.</p>
<p><code>\BlockImage</code> places the image as a block element. It may be accompanied by text, within the same block. IMPORTANT: Beginning with version 1.46, the behavior of this command has changed. See its description, below.</p>
<p>If your book has a lot of images mingled with text, then you should consider using a page layout program (such as Scribus) instead of TeX. That's because the best strategies for an image-intensive picture book are very different from the strategies adoped by <i>novel</i>.</p>
<p>&bull; Beware of image overlap. Images are not allowed to overlap each other, in the kind of commercial printing that is likely to be used for your book. However, since overlap is generally legal in PDF, TeX will not issue an error.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not use the ordinary TeX commands, or environments, for floats or figures.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not rotate an image in TeX. Prepare the rotated image in a graphics program, flatten it at correct size and dpi, then insert the pre-rotated image.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not scale or crop an image in TeX. Do it in a graphics program. Be sure that the finished image is flattened, at correct size and dpi.</p>

<h4 id="h7.3.1">7.3.1. Image-Like Effects in Text</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.3.1">
<p class="noindent">You may scale, rotate, and displace text. This is done using text commands, and the result is still text. When cleverly done, it provides an image-like effect. See <a href="#h6">section 6</a> for the possibilities.</p> 
</div><!-- end 7.3.1 -->

<h4 id="h7.3.2">7.3.2 <code>\InlineImage[<em>hoffset,voffset</em>]{<em>imageFile.png or .jpg</em>}</code> and starred version</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.3.2">
<p class="noindent">This command places the image as an inline element, at 100% scale. The use of <i>png</i> or <i>jpg</i> images, with file extension, is required.<p>
<p>You may offset the image horizontally or vertically. Positive direction is to the right and up. If you use one offset, then you must use both (if necessary, <i>0em</i>). Any units of length may be used, but the preferred units are <i>em</i> or <code>\textwidth</code> for horizontal, and <i>em</i> or <code>\nbs</code> for vertical, because these are most compatible with the <code><a href="#hA">\Rework</a></code> commands.</p>
<p>By default, the <em>top</em> of the image is at the text baseline. If you prefer that the <em>bottom</em> of the image be at the text baseline, use voffset <i>b</i>. Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\InlineImage[0em,b]{imageFile.png}</code></p>
<p>Thanks to the included <i>calc</i> package, offsets may use <code>\widthof{<em>text</em>}</code>, <code>\heightof{<em>text</em>}</code>, or <code>\depthof{<em>text</em>}</code>  as lengths. The most useful of these is when you wish to align the top of an image at the X-height of surrounding text:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\InlineImage[0em,\heightof{X}]{imageFile.png}</code></p>
<p>You may also use <code>\heightof{\Aring}</code> for the tallest accented letter normally found in Latin-1.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to align the bottom of an image with the lowercase descender:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\InlineImage[0em,b-\depthof{gjpqy}]{imageFile.png}</code></p>
<p>Lengths <code>\imagewidth</code> and <code>\imageheight</code> may also be used for offsets. These lengths remain set, and can be used for other purposes (such as displacing text) until another image is placed.</p>
<p>Offsets may be written as combinations of lengths. If you use the baseline <i>b</i> as above, it must be the first character of voffset. If you use <code>\widthof</code> or <code>\heightof</code>, then its backslash must be the first character <em>unless</em> it is preceded by another length. Thus, an offset of <code>-\heightof{X}</code> is prohibited, but you can use <code>0pt-\heightof{X}</code>.
<p>Here are some examples of allowable code:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\InlineImage[2.3em, -0.4em]{imageFile.png}<br/>
\InlineImage[0pt-\widthof{eee}, b+\heightof{X}-0.2em]{imageFile.jpg}
</code></p>
<p>The image occupies zero vertical space. So, it will not push apart baselines. The next line(s) of text may overlie the image. In some cases, this is desirable. If you do not want that effect, then you can either insert a suitable number of <code>\null</code> lines after the image, or use the <code>\BlockImage</code> command instead.</p>
<p>With the un-starred <code>\InlineImage</code> command, the image occupies its natural horizontal width. That is, text following the image will (if it fits) continue from the right edge of the image. But with the starred <code>\InlineImage*</code> command, the image occupies zero width. In this case, text following the image will continue from the left of the image, and overlie the image.</p>
<p>Having text overlie the image is allowable, and can create some interesting special effects. But when your print service sees what you have done, they may think that it is a mistake. Be sure that you discuss this with them.</p>
<p>If you do allow text to overlie an image, be sure that the image is very light. Repeat: <em>very light</em>. Depending on the printing technology, an image may print darker than you see on your computer screen, and that would make text hard to read. At low print volume, your print service will probably use a technology that is like an industrial-strength home inkjet printer, which can make very sharp text over images. However, if your book goes to volume production, then the technology will be different. Volume printing will use halftoned images, and the text overlay may also become halftoned, which will reduce its sharpness considerably.</p>
<p>Note that an image may be placed in a way that prints some of the image in the margin. That's allowable if your margin is wider than the minimum required for printing clearance. But even if it is not allowable, there will be no complaint or warning from TeX. Use the <a href="#h2.3">shademargins</a> class option to ascertain position.</p>
<p>Do not place an image so that it approaches or goes beyond the page edge. That requires a "bleed box" which is not part of <i>novel</i> capabilities. If your book needs that kind of image handling, use a page layout program instead.</p>
<p>Do not place images so that they overlap. Although that is allowed in the PDF, it is likely to be flagged as an error by your print service.</p>
</div><!-- end 7.3.2 -->

<h4 id="h7.3.3">7.3.3. Text Over <code>\InlineImage</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.3.3">
<p class="noindent">As noted above, an <code>\InlineImage</code> (or its starred version) can be used as the background to any subsequent text. Just as with any other text, whatever sits atop an image must be pure black. If you need text in gray, then you must integrate the rasterized text with the image in an external graphics program, instead of typing the text in your document.</p>
<p>When text overlies an image, it retains its identity as vector paths, as far as the PDF is concerned. In some printing processes, particularly those for very low volume production, the result will be as sharp and dark as ordinary text. However, if your book sells well (or is being prepared to sell well), the image will be converted to halftone, and the text that lies above it may also be converted to halftone. This will reduce the sharpness of the text. It is not necessarily a problem, unless your text is very small or has fine details.</p>
<p>If the text-over-image is part of a title, then the text is naturally large and dark, and will easily withstand halftoning.</p>
<p>Be aware that not all print services will accept text over images. It's not that they <em>cannot</em> do it; after all, your home and office printers can easily do it. The reason they object is because the pages of your book will be handled in small volume by persons who are unfamiliar with the book. Text over an image may be flagged as a printing error or a bug in the PDF. In the advertising world, text over image is routine. But in the world of fictional novels, it is unusual. Don't imagine that they will decide what you meant to do, by reading your book. Also, very sharp image/text, at low printing volume, will not appear as sharp when the technology changes for higher volume production. They know that, but are not sure if <em>you</em> know that.</p>
<p>An inline image occupies zero vertical space. If you place its top near the bottom of the textblock, then the image will happily flow into the lower margin and perhaps off the bottom of the page, without an error (but the print service will reject it). The reason that TeX does not provide an error message is quite simple: Technically, it is not an error! It is just not what you meant to do. The software cannot read your mind. This is where the <a href="#h2.3">shademargins</a> class option helps.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\noindent\InlineImage*[0pt,1.2\nbs]{gavel.png} Lord Withens took a seat at the rear of the courtroom, attempting to be inconspicuous. Yet his effort was in vain, as he was the only person there with a riding crop and spurs.\par<br/>
He would have taken the car, had it not been stolen. But that was why he was here, at the arraignment of the person charged with the theft. It was most unfortunate that the accused was his own elderly father; but then, theft ran in the family line.\par

</div><!-- end 7.3.3 -->

<h4 id="h7.3.4">7.3.4. <code>\BlockImage[<em>alignment,hoffset,voffset</em>]{<em>imageFile.png or .jpg</em>}[<em>accompanying text</em>]</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.3.4">
<p>The <code>\BlockImage</code> command places its image as a block element, distinct from the preceding or following text. Be sure to close the preceding paragraph before writing <code>\BlockImage</code>.</p>
<p>The command takes an optional argument with up to three comma-separated values. The first is <i>alignment</i>: <code>l</code>, <code>c</code>, or <code>r</code> for left, center, or right. The second and third values are lengths, <i>hoffset</i> and <i>voffset</i> for the image. Positive offsets are up and right.</p>
<p>Unlike the <code>\InlineImage</code> command, you may not use "b" in the vertical offset. By default, the top of the image is aligned to the baseline of where text would be, if you did not place an image. You may find that <code>\normalXheight</code> is a useful vertical offset, at it aligns the top of the image to where the X-height would be.</p>
<p>Following the mandatory image filename, an optional argument allows text to appear in the same block as the image. See the next section.</p>
<p>An automatic calculation ensures that text after <code>\BlockImage</code> will comfortably clear the bottom of the image (taking its voffset into account). The text will be on-grid.</p>
<p>Remember that TeX does not care if the image overflows into the margins. Thus, you must review the PDF to ensure that an image does not appear in an unsuitable location. You can visualize margins using the <i>draft,shademargins</i> document class options.</p>
</div><!-- end 7.3.4 -->

<h4 id="h7.3.5">7.3.5. <code>\BlockImage</code> with Accompanying Text</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.3.5">
<p><b>Attention:</b> Changed behavior of <code>\BlockImage</code> in v. 1.46. See <a href="#hNI.3">Issue NI.3</a></p>
<p class="noindent">The second optional argument of <code>\BlockImage</code>, following the image filename, may contain text that will accompany the image in the same block of vertical space. The text may be more than one paragraph.</p>
<p>This feature is of limited usefulness in the main body of text. Its primary purpose is to assist with layout of things such as title page and chapter starts, where there might be an image mingled with text.</p>
<p>If the image is aligned at left or right, then the accompanying text block will be separated from the image by the length of the normal paragraph indent. Within this block, the text will be justified. The usual indentation rules apply.</p>
<p>If the image is aligned at center, then the accompanying text will also be centered (and usually will overlie the image). If you wish to confine the width of this text block to less than the full page text width, then wrap the accompanying text (inside the brackets) in an <i>adjustwidth</i> environment.</p>
<p>Whatever the alignment of image offset, the first line of accompanying text will be vertically located on-grid, where the first line of text would ordinarily sit. If you wish to displace it vertically, then begin the accompanying text with <code>\pushtextdown{<em>length</em>}</code>. It is best to measure the length in terms of the normal baselineskip, <code>\nbs</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot automatically "flow" text around an image in <i>novel</i> class. Although there is a LaTeX package that will do that, parts of it are incompatible with the grid structure of <i>novel</i>, so the package is disallowed. If you cleverly place just the right amount of accompanying text, then you can fill the area next to the image; but this is not automated.</p>
<p>If you write too much accompanying text, it will overflow into the text that follows. There is no automatic increase in the vertical space reserved for the image.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code><small>It was a dark and stormy night. Lord Withens mounted his horse and rode through the darkness, accidentally trampling some petunias in Her Ladyship's garden.\par<br/>
\BlockImage[r]{gnome.png}[\pushtextdown{2\nbs}Suddenly he was confronted by an irate gnome, who expressed an opinion in the crudest of language, even for a gnome.\par]<br/>
Lord Withens shrugged, and rode on. There was nothing to do but remain silent, this time taking more care. He would speak with his wife about the gnome situation when he returned.\par</small></code></p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/gnome-censored.png" width="437" height="270" alt="example of BlockImage with accompanying text"/></p>
<p>&bull; In general, avoid using accompanying text with an image, with the possible exception of titles and other special layouts. There is little need for it in the flowing text of a novel. If you find that you need to use it frequently, then perhaps your book would benefit from a page layout program such as <i>Scribus</i>, instead of TeX.</p>

<h3 id="h7.4">7.4. Color Cover Artwork</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d7.4">
<p class="noindent">This portion serves a limited purpose. It is for the benefit of those who need to submit color print cover artwork in the form of a PDF/X-1a:2001 file, with the artwork as CMYK and 240% ink limit. This is the format required by some American print-on-demand services. It is also generally acceptable to others, whose requirements are less restrictive.</p>
<p>Example cover artwork can be found at the <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://github.com/RobtAll/novel/">GitHub project page</a>, in the "other" folder.</p>
<p><b>Before you begin:</b> Do you really need to do this? Many print-on-demand services are perfectly happy to accept something such as an ordinary RGB jpeg image, as long as it has the correct size (with bleed area). They can easily process it for print production in a few moments, using professional software. If they do it, then whether or not you are surprised by the resulting colors, will depend on whether or not your original image is within the printer gamut. In other cases, the print service prefers (or insists) that you do the image print production processing yourself. Then, you get to see an emulation of the print colors <em>before</em> you submit the file, and can change your artwork if the resulting colors are disappointing.</p>
<p>The <em>novel</em> document class does not provide any support for creating the original artwork, either image or text. In fact, TeX is not the best way to do that. Use a graphics program (such as the free GIMP) to do your artwork, including text. In the end, your text will be rasterized, just like any background image. For this reason, avoid using small text, or consider using a sans-serif typeface on the cover (even though there is no sans-serif in the book itself).</p>
<p>DO NOT PLACE A BARCODE. If your print service requests a white rectangle where the barcode will go, then include it in your image. Almost every print service is willing to create the barcode from your ISBN, and place the barcode image into your PDF during post-processing. Most of them even demand that they do it themselves. Do-it-yourself barcodes are incompatible with the following instructions.</p>
<p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This documentation, and its accompanying software, is offered AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. USE ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK. The author is an amateur who does not profess expertise in these matters. The best I can say is, "It works for me."</p>

<h4 id="h7.4.1">7.4.1. Begin With PNG</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.4.1">
<p class="noindent">Create your artwork, including all text (but not barcode or barcode text) using whatever means you have. How you do it is not relevant. To follow these instructions, you must provide the artwork as a flattened (no transparency) PNG format image, at correct size (including bleed area) and resolution (dpi).</p>
<p style="margin-top:8px"><b>Example:</b> Suppose your book is 5.5" x 8.5" softcover, a typical size for American fiction. Based on its page count and paper, you are told that the spine width must be 0.62". The required bleed width, on all four sides, must be 0.125".</p>
<p>Then, the image is 0.125 + 5.5 + 0.62 + 5.5 + 0.125 = 11.87in wide.</p>
<p>The image is 0.125 + 8.5 + 0.125 = 8.75in high.</p>
<p>At 300dpi resolution (a typical value) the image must be 11.87 x 300 = 3561 pixels wide, and 8.75 x 300 = 2625 pixels high. In case of fractional pixels, round upward. The exact pixel count is important.</p>
<p style="margin-top:8px">It is best to use the AdobeRGB1998 color workspace, or equivalent. But you can also use sRGB, or equivalent, and in many cases you will not notice much difference. It is helpful to attach (embed) the workspace color profile in your PNG image, especially if it is something other than AdobeRGB1998 or sRGB. Note that the workspace is NOT the color profile of your monitor (if you have it). If you do not attach (embed) the workspace color profile, then remember whether you were using AdobeRGB1998 or sRGB. If you make a mistake here, it is not fatal. It merely means that some colors (particularly bright greens and blue-greens) will print somewhat brighter or duller than you were expecting.</p>
<p>When done, export it as a flattened PNG.</p>
<p>If you are provided with an image other than PNG, you have to convert it to PNG. No alternative. It is easy enough to use GIMP to convert most image formats. If you have a PDF (which is not already in the required format), GIMP can probably open it as an image. Be sure you import it with the correct resolution. Again, the pixel width and height are important.</p>
<p><b>Cover Text:</b> These instructions assume that your cover text is rasterized, and is part of the image rather than vector text. In many cases your graphics program has enough text capability to do what you need.</p>
<p>If you wish to use TeX to typeset the cover text, do it this way: Use TeX to create one or more PDFs of the cover text, without images. You can create several blocks of text at different pages sizes, if you wish. Open your background artwork in GIMP. Add a new transparent layer above it. Open a text PDF in GIMP. Choose resolution 300dpi, full antialiasing, grayscale or color. The opened text is now a raster image. Copy it, and paste it atop the transparent layer. Anchor it. Use Color: Color to Alpha: white to alpha filter. That removes the white area from the PDF image. Finally, move the text to where it should go. You can rotate the text 90 degrees, but do not resize it! If you would rather the text be at a different size, then either change it in TeX, or use a different resolution when you open the PDF in GIMP. Note that even when you open the PDF at a different resolution, it will still be at 300dpi when you place it over the 300dpi background image; but its size will change.</p>

<p>The report should show that the image is CMYK, that it is at 300 pixels/inch, and that there is NO entry for "Profile-color". It will not have anything to say about ink limit, or SWOP.</p>
</div><!-- end 7.4.3 -->

<h4 id="h7.4.4">7.4.4. Convert your CMYK Image to PDF/X.</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.4.4">
<p class="noindent">Up to now, you did not need TeX. Now you do. Be sure that you have a working TeX installation, with the <em>novel</em> document class package.</p>
<p>In folder (your TeX root)/doc/lualatex/novel/extras you will find file "novel-cover-template.tex". Place a copy in the same working folder as your image, and modify it as needed.</p>
<p><code>\SetMediaSize</code> refers to the full size of the image, with units (usually in). This includes the bleed box. For example, <code>\SetMediaSize{11.87in}{8.75in}</code>.</p>
<p><code>\SetTrimSize</code> refers to the trimmed image, without bleed. For example, <code>\SetTrimSize{11.62in}{8.5in}</code>.</p>
<p><code>\SetPDFX[CGATSTR001]{X-1a:2001}</code> will get you "US Web Coated SWOP v2" output intent (most common the USA), and PDF/X-1a:2001 compliance. The Output Intent *.icc color profile will NOT be embedded, because this is almost always the way that print services want it. The PDF contains a code identifying the intent, so there is no need to embed the color profile (and disadvantages to embedding it). In the unlikely event that they demand the Output Intent color profile embedded, put an asterisk on the command.</p>
<p>For compliance you need to use <code>\SetTitle</code>. The title for this file might not be the title of your book, because this file isn't your book. Ask you print service what they want. Same with <code>\SetAuthor</code>.</p>
<p>You can use <code>\SetApplication</code> and <code>\SetProducer</code> to change internal identifiers. Don't use these unless you have a reason.</p>
<p><code>\SetCoverImage</code> is self-explanatory. Must have file extension jpg, jpeg, JPG, or JPEG. Must be CMYK. Note that TeX cannot verify whether the image is in correct color space. It will compile, even if the image is wrong. Beware!</p>
<p>Do not attempt to write anything between <code>\begin{document}</code> and <code>\end{document}</code>. If you erroneously put some text there, the document will probably compile, and it may even be a valid PDF/X file. However, the resulting text color will almost surely be wrong. If so, the problem will be detected when you submit your file (wrong ink limit or color space).</p>
<p>Compiling may take a little longer than expected. If your TeX system opens a PDF viewer automatically, the image might be missing (or partial) until a few seconds after the viewer opens. Be patient. The file size is large.</p>
</div><!-- end 7.4.4 -->

<h4 id="h7.4.5">7.4.5. Final Check</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d7.4.5">
<p class="noindent">Open the PDF in Adobe Reader, which does a trick that no other free software will do, to my knowledge. If your platform does not have Adobe Reader, then find a friend who has it. May be a different platform.</p>
<p>In Adobe Reader, go to Edit, Preferences, Documents. Check "Save As optimizes for fast web view." Then go to Edit, Preferences, Page Display. Check "Show art, trim, and bleed boxes." Then OK.</p>
<p>Open your PDF. You should see a light green box, just inside the image boundary. This shows the Trim Area. This box does not print; it is only for visualization. Go to File, Properties, Fonts. There should be no fonts listed.</p>
<p>Then, "Save As" the same file name (or another one, if you prefer). This will optimize the file. You probably do not need to do that, but it does not hurt, and a few services expect it.</p>
<p>There will always be some difference between color as viewed on your monitor, and color as printed. This is due to the difference between emitted light (your monitor) and reflected light (print). In professional use, the monitor will be calibrated, and operated at a specific screen brightness. The print will be viewed under lighting with a specific color temperature and illumination. Your own colors are not that critical, are they? If you have a calibrated monitor, and view the PDF and images in color-managed software, then what you see on your computer will be reasonably close to what prints. If your monitor is not calibrated, or you are not using color-managed software, then the printed cover may have its greens a bit more colorful than you were expecting. That doesn't mean there will be a greenish cast. It merely means that things such as spring leaves and shamrocks will be a bit greener (in print) than you expected.</p>

<h2 id="h8">8. Book Design</h2>
<div class="d2" id="d8">
<p class="noindent">Most authors in P.O.D. use an ordinary word processor, particularly MS Word. For that reason, many print services, and most online user forums, refer to the terminology and settings of MS Word, rather than to the meanings in traditional book publishing. In the case of images, Photoshop settings are often described.</p>
<p>Since you are neither using MS Word nor Photoshop, you must understand the terminology of printed book design. Then, you can apply that knowledge to the physical layout and internal design of your book, using <i>novel</i> document class.</p>

<h3 id="h8.1">8.1. Terminology</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d8.1">
<p class="noindent">You <i>must</i> understand these terms, as used in printing.</p>

<h4 id="h8.1.1">8.1.1. Sheet, Page, Leaf</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.1.1">
<p class="noindent">A <b>sheet</b> of paper is a single, physical piece of paper, regardless of whether anything is printed on it, or where. Often, paper starts out as a large sheet that will subsequently be cut into smaller sheets. The size doesn't matter. A sheet of paper is, in ordinary understanding, a piece of paper.</p>
<p><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/page-leaf.png" width="490" height="155" alt="page, leaf"/> In a finished book, a <b>page</b> is one side of a <b>leaf</b>. Thus, there are always exactly twice as many pages are there are leaves. From the manufacturer's point of view, a 240-page (double-sided printing) book has 120 leaves, regardless of whether or not anything is printed on the pages, or how they are numbered.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.1.1 -->

<h4 id="h8.1.2">8.1.2. Folio, Spine</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.1.2">
<p class="noindent">Imagine a single sheet of US Letter 8.5"Wx11"H paper. It has two pages, since you can print on both sides (even if one is empty).</p>
<p>If you fold that sheet in half across its width, it is still one sheet. But now you have a <b>folio</b>, consisting of two leaves of size 5.5"Wx8.5"H. Each leaf has two pages, so you now have four pages. The fold is at the <b>spine</b>.</p>
<p>Caution: The term "folio" has several different meanings, even in the narrow field of book publishing. It may refer to folded paper, as mentioned above. Or it may refer to a particular sheet size of paper ("foolscap"). Or, it may simply refer to the number printed on a page. This last use of "folio" is discussed in the context of headers and footers.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.1.2 -->

<h4 id="h8.1.3">8.1.3. Signature, Imposition</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.1.3">
<p class="noindent"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/signature.png" width="133" height="102" alt="signature"/> When a book is commercially manufactured, folios are nested to form <b>signatures</b>. The number of folios in a signature is typically 6 to 16 (that would be 24 to 64 pages). If you were hand-making a single book at home, you might use only one folio per signature.</p>
<p>Now, think about how those pages must be ordered. Suppose a book contains a single signature of 4 folios. The outermost folio is printed with pages 1 and 16 on one side (before folding), and pages 2 and 15 on its other side. The next nested folio has pages 3/14 and 4/13. Nested inside is 5/12 and 6/11. Innermost is 7/10 and 8/9.</p>
<p>Re-arranging the page order is part of the <b>imposition</b> process. The process may involve tweaking the position of each page slightly, to account for offset due to paper thickness when the folios are grouped into signatures. If numerous folios are printed on a larger sheet of paper before cutting, the process may involve rotating folios so that they waste less paper.</p>
<p>Your home printer software can probably do imposition for a single-folio design (four pages). Anything beyond that is left to professional software. You don't need to do it. The print service does it for you, automatically.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.1.3 -->
</div><!-- end 8.1 -->

<h3 id="h8.2">8.2. Book Manufacture</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d8.2">
<p class="noindent">In many cases, when you choose how your book will be manufactured, you will have <i>at most</i> these choices: Trim Size, interior b/w or color, paper, binding, cover finish. The <i>novel</i> class does not address the particular requirements of color interiors (grayscale is OK, since it is emulated by black and white). When you choose the Trim Size, other options may be limited.</p>

<h4 id="h8.2.1">8.2.1 Perfect Binding</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.2.1">
<p class="noindent"><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/perfectbinding.png" width="160" height="290" alt="perfect binding"/>Most modern softcover books (and some inexpensive hardcovers) are manufactured using a process named <b>Perfect Binding</b>.
<p>In Perfect Binding, the signatures are clamped together, and the folded area is removed by a cutting machine. Then there are no longer any folios, just individual leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are glued together at the spine, possibly with reinforcement. Note that the glue is not merely at the edge of the leaves; it penetrates the paper slightly, for better strength. Finally, the cover is attached.</p>
<p>The Perfect Binding method is inexpensive, and is more than adequate for a book that will not receive rough handling. Whether using P.O.D. or a major mass-quantity publisher, most softcover books have been made this way for a long time. Unless you know that your book will be acquired by libraries for addition to their long-term literary collection, there is little reason to have your book manufactured by any other process. The possible exception would be books for small children, which receive rough handling under all circumstances.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.2.1 -->

<h4 id="h8.2.2">8.2.2 Library Binding</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.2.2">
<p class="noindent">Libraries rarely purchase Perfect Binding books (regardless of soft or hard cover) due to lack of durability in a library environment. The exceptions are popular books of no lasting literary value, and how-to books for evolving technologies. These may be obtained by libraries in the cheapest softcover version, because such books will be discarded long before they wear out.</p>
<p>Unless you are sure that your book will be acquired by numerous libraries for long-term addition to their collections, there is little reason to produce a quality hardcover version. Not all P.O.D. services offer hardcover. If you do need a hardcover version, then be sure to carefully inquire regarding its manufacture, and preferably obtain a copy of someone else's book manufactured that way.</p>
<p><img class="floatright" src="html-resources/smythsewn.png" width="177" height="141" alt="perfect binding"/> The best hardcovers, suitable for library use, are made using the <b>Smyth Sewing</b> process. A Smyth Sewn book has signatures of (typically) 12 or 16 folios. But instead of removing the creases after folding, each signature is sewn through its crease using strong thread, onto a durable spine material. The pages will remain attached, even with hard usage. If the spine material is sufficiently flexible, then the book will lie flat when opened.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask about spine flexibility. The most flexible methods have a soft, curved spine, and are best suited to thick novels. There is also a variety that has a square (flat) spine, which will not quite lie flat when opened. Square-spine Smyth Sewn books seem to be the fashion for documenting intellectual property.</p>
<p>If a major publisher is producing a book that is sure to be ordered by many libraries, due to its author's popularity or maybe a movie tie-in, then it is likely to be released as a Smyth Sewn hardcover. That's because the production method is affordable in quantity. But on a P.O.D. basis, it is a significant expense.</p>
<p>Different bindings must have different ISBNs, because they are different products. If you need to change the dimensions of Trim Size or Margins, the <code><a href="#hA">\Rework</a></code> commands are your friends.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.2.2 -->

<h4 id="h8.2.3">8.2.3 Other Bindings</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.2.3">
<p class="noindent">If the print service offers to provide a hardcover version, you must carefully inquire as to the production method. The cheapest hardcover uses the same basic technology as Perfect-Bound softcover, except that the cover is harder. That can be done in production, or retroactively. But such a book is unlikely to be of much value, except as a personal memento.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <b>side-sewn</b> method involves stitching the pages sideways, near the spine. The resulting book is very inflexible and will not open flat, but this is the strongest method for retaining pages. Side-sewn books often are used for archival purposes (patent applications, living trusts, dissertations, etc.). This may be done in production, or retroactively. The result is of high quality, but very inappropriate for a novel. Do not do this, except as a peronal memento.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general: For general fiction where you hope for a wide audience, do not request hardcover unless you are certain that it is Smyth-Sewn, preferably with flexible binding.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you change the binding, you must also get a different ISBN. Only exception is for a private copy that will not be marketed.</p>

<p class="noindent">A Perfect Bound softcover cannot be retroactively converted to a Smyth Sewn, Library Bound hardcover. However, it is possible to convert a softcover book to some other kinds of hardcover.</p>
<p>If your book is converted, remove the ISBN, as it is inapplicable.</p>
<p>In the simplest method, the soft cover is removed, and a hard cover is glued on. The pages may be shaved in size, so that they don't edge beyond the new cover; or the new cover may be slightly over-sized. Part of the soft cover may be pasted onto the hard cover. That won't look the same as original manufacture, but it avoids creating a dust jacket. Such a hard cover book is no more durable than the softcover, no more flexible at the spine, and perhaps no more resistant to losing pages. But it has a harder cover. The only reason for doing this is to provide souvenir copies for yourself and your family.</p>
<p>A more advanced method involves adding strength to the glued spine, by <b>side-sewing</b> the pages, before adding the hard cover. This results in a book that is much less flexible at the spine, and much less likely to lose pages. Papers of legal signficance (patent applications, real estate trusts, dissertations, etc.) are often done this way. Beware of services that offer to convert your softcover to hardcover by this method, since it is inappropriate for something such as a novel.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.2.3 -->

<h4 id="h8.2.4">8.2.4. Paper and Cover Materials</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.2.4">
<p class="noindent">The interior paper may be white or "creme" (off-white). White paper is generally used for nonfiction, and must be used if there are interior color images. Creme paper is generally used for fiction. The idea is that white paper creates an air of authority, whereas creme paper is more comfortable for lengthy reading. I agree. I recently read a novel that was (mis-) printed on white paper, and it was hard to read in a bright area. So, for your novel, choose creme paper.</p>
<p>The cover of a Perfect-Binding softcover book may be produced with a glossy or a matte finish. The fashion is to use glossy for nonfiction, matte for fiction. Again, the idea is authority versus comfort. But you may choose what you wish. "Instant Best-Seller" mass-market paperbacks  often have an embossed texture, and maybe even metal foil. In the print-on-demand market, forget it. Don't even think about it.</p>
<p>If you do request a hardcover edition, then it may or may not have a dust jacket (costs extra). The general rule is that books for libraries have a dust jacket, which will be encased in plastic by the library. Books for documentation generally have no dust jacket, with the title and other info embossed in the cover material, for permanance.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.2.4 -->
</div><!-- end 8.2 -->

<h3 id="h8.3">8.3. Interior Structure</h3>
<div class="d3" id="d8.3">
<p class="noindent">This section discusses how a book is designed, in terms of its component pages, where they are placed, and how they are styled. The emphasis is on popular fiction. Some sections that would be required in a dissertation or other nonfiction, are much rarer in popular fiction, or are entirely missing. There is also considerable "wiggle room" in terms of structure, particularly for genres that <i>pretend to be</i> a truthful report of someone else's writing.</p>
<p>The advice you are about to receive is <em>not</em> authoritative. It is combined from <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> (which focuses on nonfiction) and on actual practice, as I have seen by looking through numerous professionally-published works of popular fiction at the local public library. There is a certain amount of variation.</p>

<h4 id="h8.3.1">8.3.1. Display Pages vs. Chapter-Like Sections</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.3.1">

<h5 id="h8.3.1.1">8.3.1.1. Display Pages</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.1.1">
<p class="noindent">A <em>Display Page</em> has its own design, and stands by itself. Examples are Half-Title, Title, Copyright, Dedication, Epigraph, Table of Contents, Map, Part Separator, and of course Blank.</p>
<p>Half-Title, Title, Dedication, and Part Separators are always single-page recto. A Table of Contents begins recto, but may continue verso. An Epigraph is single-page, and may be recto or verso.</p>
<p>Maps are one per page, and may be recto or verso. If you intend to create a large map that spreads verso-recto, be aware that the technology you will be using does not allow continuous image through the spine area. Instead, you must create two separate maps, one per page. There will be the usual inner margins.</p>
<p>A Blank page is almost always verso; the only exception is when multiple blanks appear at the very end of the book.</p>
<p>Each kind of display page has its own style, and position. What they have in common is that all of them lack a header or footer (and thus, lack a printed page number). Use <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code>.</p>
<p>If a display page extends to a second page (such as Table of Contents), then use <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> at its begining and end, to ensure that both pages omit header and footer.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.1.1 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.1.2">8.3.1.2. Chapter-Like Sections</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.1.2">
<p>A <em>Chapter-Like Section</em> includes things that are styled like a chapter. This includes Foreword, Preface, Introduction, Author's Note, Acknowledgements, Prologue, Chapters, Epilogue, Conclusion, Endnotes.</p>
<p>A Chapter-Like Section begins recto. However, chapters <i>after</i> Chapter One may begin recto or verso. If there is subsequent material (Epilogue, Conclusion, Endnotes, etc.) then the begin-recto rule applies.</p>
<p>The first page of a Chapter-Like Section section has no header, but <i>may</i> have a footer with page number. See the available choices for <code><a href="#h4.3.5.1">\thispagestyle</a></code>.</p>
<p>Remaining pages in the section will have such header/footer style as pertains to ordinary chapters in the book. Exception: If a Chapter-Like Section in front matter is only two pages long, then you may optionally omit the header, or footer, on both pages. Then, use <code>\thispagestyle</code> at the end of the section, with choice that matches its beginning.</p>
<p>When a Chapter-Like Section appears in front matter, its page headers (if any) do <em>not</em> show the author and title of the book, the way they would appear in main matter. Instead, they show the name of the section (such as Author's Note) both verso and recto. Commands <code><a href="#h4.3.4.6">\SetVersoHeadText</a></code> and <code><a href="#h4.3.4.6">\SetRectoheadText</a></code> are your friends, as they permit you to dynamically change header text as you move through the book.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.1.2 -->
</div><!-- end 8.3.1 -->

<h4 id="h8.3.2">8.3.2. Front Matter</h4>
<div class="d4" id="8.3F.2">
<p class="noindent">The <code><b>\frontmatter</b></code> command must be written immediately after <code>\begin{document}</code>. This sets page numbering to lowercase roman, and performs some other actions.</p>
<p>A book's front matter is <em>about the book</em>. It is not part of the story. The only mandatory front matter is the Title Page and its verso, the Copyright Page. On a practical basis, six pages of front matter are the minimum, and this minimum is often used, even by major publishers. See <a href="#hB">Appendix B</a> for how to construct basic six-page front matter.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.1">8.3.2.1. Half-Title, page i</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.1">
<p class="noindent"><p>Some book manufacturers (particulary in hardcover) place a blank or decorative <em>flyleaf</em> before any part of the book interior. A flyleaf (if present) is added at the bookbinding factory, and is not part of your book's interior PDF file.</p>
<p>Your book's first interior recto page is a Half-Title. It is a <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>. Historically it was a protective page for the full title page, in the era when a printed interior was not immediately bound. That tradition lives on.</p>
<p>The Half-Title contains nothing but the book's title. No subtitle. It should be styled in the same manner as is used on the full Title Page, but typically smaller. You can place the title anywhere it looks good. It is almost never placed upper left.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.2.1 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.2.2">8.3.2.2. Blank, page ii</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.2">
<p class="noindent">Verso page ii is a <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>. In most cases, it will be blank. This is achieved by using <code>\cleartorecto</code> at the end of the Half-Title page. But if you wish to manually create a blank page, verso or recto:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\clearpage\thispagestyle{empty}\null\clearpage</code></p>
<p>Instead of blank, prolific authors may show a list of their books. However, even if you wrote other books, many print services won't allow you to list them, unless the same service exclusively carries all of them.</p>
<p>Major publishers may provide an advertisement for the related movie. In the good old days (looong ago) an expensive book might have a high-quality illustration, known as Frontispiece. Unless you truly know what you are doing, avoid these, and just use a blank page.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.2.2 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.2.3">8.3.2.3. Title Page, iii</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.3">
<p class="noindent">The Title Page is a recto <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a> It shows the title, subtitle (if any), and author. These elements are often very decorative, and may involve imagery. They must exactly match the information you provided when you obtained the book's ISBN. Exception: Some services allow the author's name to use initials.</p>
<p>If there is a publisher's imprint, it goes at the base. This is achieved by using <code>\vfill</code> just above it.</p>
<p>Remember that a self-publishing service is not the publisher; <em>you are</em>. That's why it is called self-publishing. If you don't have anything else to put there, and don't like leaving the base of the page empty, you might use "Independently Published in Your City, YourState" or something similar.</p>
<p>&bull; Note: Others have written (and I agree) that the surest sign that a book was written by an amateur, is when the Title Page simply uses the book's main text font (perhaps bold and larger). That has "term paper" written all over it. Instead, be creative.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.2.3 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.2.4">8.3.2.4. Copyright Page, iv</h5>
<div class="d5" id="8.3.2.4">
<p class="noindent">The Copyright Page is a verso <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>. It is primarily legalistic in nature, providing essential details about the book, as an item in commerce.</p>
<p>Some nations require specific information to appear on a Copyright Page. That is your responsibility to know, and is beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
<p>At least in the U.S.A., the nation where the book is printed must be indicated, either on the Copyright Page or some other allowed location (such as the final verso). Many print-on-demand services use multiple printers, which may be in various nations, depending on who purchases your book. With the services I have used, this is solved by omitting "Printed in the United States of America" on the Copyright page, because it may not be true. At the printing factory, the necessary information is added by them, as a Colophon on the final verso page. This is one reason why that final verso page must be blank (in your PDF). Ask your P.O.D. service.</p>
<p>A Copyright Page is in ordinary text, perhaps using minimal styling such as italics or small caps. In all cases, its overall page style must differ from the page style of main text. Almost always, the content of the Copyright Page is forced downward, so that excess white space is on top, and the final line appears at the base of the textblock. This is achieved using <code>\null\vfill</code> at the beginning of the page.</p>
<p>The <i>legalese</i> environment prevents hyphenation, aligns paragraphs ragged-right (instead of justified), and omits paragraph indents. This style is widely used for a Copyright Page. Be sure to use <code>\null</code>, or a similar vertical spacing command, to separate paragraphs. If you nest the <code>center</code> environment within <i>legalese</i>, it will over-ride the ragged-right alignment.</p>
<p>The <i>adjustwidth</i> environment can be used to set the width of the lines at less than the full width. This is especially helpful if you have little to say, and choose to center the content.</p>
<p>Always review where lines break, if necessary insrting manual line breaks, to ensure that the meaning is sensible.</p>
<p>If you use them, certain words or phrases such as <span style="text-transform:lowercase; font-variant:small-caps">FIRST EDITION</span> are traditionally set in all small caps. Use <code>\allsmcp{FIRST EDITION}</code>.</p>
<p>Numbers, such as date and ISBN, may be Old Style or Lining. The text default is probably Old Style. If you prefer Lining (looks more legalistic), then use <code>\lnum{<em>numbers</em>}</code>. Anything other than digits (and related characters) will remain unchanged by the <code>\lnum</code> command.
<p>The Copyright Symbol © is pasted from a Unicode character map. Avoid using TeX code.</p>
<p>I have never seen a Copyright Page extend to a second page. Never. If you have that much to say, it may be that some of the information may be moved to an Author's Note or Acknowledgements section. Or, if necessary, you may use the <i>parascale</i> environment to slightly shrink the text and baseline skip.</p>
<p>If you have a Cataloging-in-Publication data block (probably you do not), then be aware that its content may be provided to you in MS Word format. Pay attention to indents, as they are part of how the data is presented. Use <code>\forceindent</code> or <code>\backindent</code> to over-ride the normal indentation (or lack thereof). Use the <i>adjustwidth</i> environment for block indents, but be aware that nesting one <i>adjustwidth</i> inside another may cause problems. It is better to end one <i>adjustwidth</i> before beginning a new one.</p>
<p>Also, CIP data uses emdash in places. MS Word may represent an emdash with <i>two</i> hyphens, whereas TeX uses <i>three</i> hyphens. Better to simply paste the emdash from a Unicode character map, which will appear the same in both MS Word and TeX.</p>
<p>If you need straight apostrophe or straight quotes, use <code>\straightquote</code> and <code>\straightdblquote</code> to insert a character that won't be converted to curly. These commands gobble the following space, in usual TeX fashion.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.2.4 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.2.5">8.3.2.5. Dedication</h5>

<p class="noindent">If you use a Dedication, it is a recto <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>, and must be placed immediately facing the Copyright Page.</p>
<p>A Dedication is not required. But sadly, nowadays many authors write a frivolous Dedication, which detracts from the book. If you feel that you need a Dedication, why not put it on your web site? Then you can always edit or remove it, if the subject of your affection runs off with someone else (or, you do). Keep it simple.</p>
<p>A Dedication is centered. If it is more than a few words, use the <i>adjustwidth</i> environment to keep it bounded, as you would for an Epigraph.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.6">8.3.2.6. Epigraph</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.6">
<p class="noindent">If you use an Epigraph, it is a <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>, which may be placed verso or recto.</p>
<p>An Epigraph is optional. It is a short quotation, traditionally from a work by someone else. Its purpose is to set the tone of your own book, or shamelessly imply that your own talents resemble that of the person quoted. However, even though it is short, do not place copyrighted material there, unless you have the necessary legal permission. You probably don't, so forget about quoting a famous contemporary author or performer. Quotations from the Bible, Shakespeare, and Nineteenth-Century authors are popular; but even then, a more recent translation may be still under copyright.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can quote from your own book, or make up something entirely new. One famous Epigraph is used in J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy, in which each book uses the long form of the Ring's incantation as its Epigraph.</p>
<p>One possible use of an Epigraph is on recto page v, in books that lack a Dedication, a Table of Contents, or other important front matter beyond the Copyright Page. Alternatively, if a book has both Dedication and Table of Contents, an Epigraph may be placed on the otherwise-blank verso page vi between them. Or, an Epigraph may appear in some later convenient place in front matter.</p>
<p>In general, an Epigraph is set as a centered block, not occupying the full page width. The <i>adjustwidth</i> environment serves this purpose. You will have to manually adjust the widths at left and right, for best visual effect.</p>
<p>The source of the quotation should be right-justified within the block, and may be preceded by an emdash. Typically, names of people are not italicized, but titles of books are. It is not necessary to give elaborate details; this is not a bibliography.<p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.7">8.3.2.7. Table of Contents</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.7">
<p class="noindent">If you use a Table of Contents, it is a <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>, beginning recto. If a second page is needed, add <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> after the table completes, but before you clear that page.</p>
<p>Most fiction does not have, and does not need, a Table of Contents. It is more useful when the story consists of discrete episodes with distinctive names, not just numbers. Or, if the book is a collection of short stories, a table of contents is suggested. If your book is a critical edition, or has sections by different authors, then a Table of Contents is mandatory.</p>
<p>Avoid any of the table environments that come with TeX or its packages. These do not provide the most attractive presentation for fiction, without a lot of work on your part.</p>
<p>A Table of Contents has no header or footer, and no printed page number. Use <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code>. If it continues to a second page, add <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> at the end, if you don't know where the page breaks.</p>
<p>Anything preceding a Table of Contents is not listed in the table. Neither is the table itself. An Epigraph is normally not listed, even if it follows the table.</p>
<p>You may or may not list maps or other illustrations in the table. Fiction rarely has more than a map or two, easily located in front matter by the reader, so there's no need to mention them. Use your judgement. That's different from the practice in nonfiction, especially academic works, where the illustrations convey factual data rather than artistry.</p>
<p>A basic Table of Contents uses the <i>center</i> environment, so that the Table's title and each entry appear centered on the page, without any fancy layout. So simple. So effective. However, if you prefer a more rectangular table, <i>novel</i> has commands for this purpose.</p>

<h6 id="h8.3.2.7.1"><span class="n"></span>8.3.2.7.1. The <i>toc</i> Environment</h6>
<div class="d6" id="u8.3.2.7.1">
<p class="noindent">Unlike some other TeX document classes, <i>novel</i> will not automatically build a Table of Contents. Also, LaTeX commands related to tables are generally disabled; adding other packages does not help (and may hurt).</p>
<p>You may create a Table of Contents in your own style, or use the <i>toc</i> environment for <i>novel's</i> own style. The choice is yours.</p>
<p class="code"><code>\begin{toc}[<em>extra entry separation</em>]{<em>extra margins</em>} <em>...</em> \end{toc}</code></p>
<p>The table is not indented, and text within it is not indented.</p>
<p>The optional argument is a number. It is the portion of normal baselineskip that will be added beneath each <code>\tocitem</code> entry. Default is 0, meaning that there is no extra skip between items, and normal baselineskip is maintained. A value greater than 0 spreads the entries, which could be attractive if there are only a few chapters and you'd like to use more space on the page. For example, a value of <i>0.25</i> means that a gap of 0.25 normal baselineskip will be added beneath each entry. A small negative value will crowd the lines together, but there is a limit (approximately -0.1) before the lines cannot be squeezed any tighter.</p>
<p>Note that the optional argument only applies to <code>\tocitem</code> entries, not to any other text within the environment.</p>
<p>The required argument is a length, which will be the amount of extra margin added at left and right of the table (using <i>adjustwidth</i>). A value of <i>0em</i> allows the table to occupy the full width of the textblock. A value of <i>2em</i> adds 2em to the margin on each side, so that the width of the table is 4em less than the width of the textblock.</p>
<p>It is best to specify horizontal lengths in units of <i>em</i> or the proportional <code>\parindent</code> or <code>\textwidth</code>.</p>
<p>Place at least one empty line above the Table's title, using <code>\null</code> or <code>\vspace*</code>. This will prevent the title (which is normally enlarged using <code>\charscale</code>) from encroaching into the top margin.</p>
<p class="code"><code>\tocitem[<em>chapter number</em>]{<em>description</em>}{<em>page number</em>}</code> and starred</p>
<p>Use this command for entries in the Table. Do not use it for non-Table text on the page.</p>
<p>The optional argument is the <i>chapter number</i>, at most two digits. The number will be left-aligned, with a period automatically added. Following the period will be whatever amount of space is needed to keep the following description aligned.</p>
<p>If the optional argument is omitted (or empty), then the <i>description</i> will align to the left of the table.</p>
<p>If the optional argument is the tilde character ~ then no number or period is printed, but the space for <i>chapter number</i> is occupied, so that the following <i>description</i> aligns as if you had entered a <i>chapter number</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>description</i> is usually the chapter title. If it cannot easily fit on one line, then use an additional <code>\tocitem</code>, because the text cannot be wrapped. The following example shows how this can be done.</p>
<p>Without the asterisk, <code>\tocitem</code> fills the area between the description and the page number with empty space. The more popular, starred <code>\tocitem*</code> command fills with a dotted line, and is very attractive.</p>
<p>You may use ordinary style commands, such as <code>\textit</code>, in the entries.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.8">8.3.2.8. Foreword, Preface, Introduction</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.8">
<p class="noindent">A Foreword, Preface, or Introduction is a <a href="#h8.3.1.2">Chapter-Like Section</a>, beginning recto.</p>
<p>A <i>Foreword</i> is written by someone other than the author. It is essentially a marketing tool, by which the publisher addes credence to the work, or mere publicity, by having an expert or celebrity write something in front matter. Introductions are common in nonfiction, but extremely rare (I have never seen one) in fiction, except for critical editions of older works (where the new, original material is essentially nonfiction).</p>
<p>A <i>Preface</i> is written by the author, speaking as author, and may include a general discussion of this and that about how the author came to write the book. It may also include acknowledgements, if they are not in a separate section. A Preface is rather formal, and very rare in popular fiction. If you wish to address the reader, the less-formal <i>Author's Note</i> is better for your purpose.</p>
<p>An <i>Introduction</i>, when used in front matter, is written by the author. Its purpose is to provide sufficient background for understanding the material that is to follow. Thus, an Introduction is sometimes seen in the front matter of historical or technical nonfiction.</p>
<p>An Introduction in front matter is inappropriate for popular fiction, but I suppose it <i>might</i> be used for the purpose of world-building in that genre, where the main story assumes that the reader is familiar with the setting. In such a case, the setup is described by the author (as author), but <i>not</i> by a character in the story. Also see <i>Author's Note</i>.</p>
<p>A Foreword, Preface, or Introduction is a "chapter-like" section. That is, its style is the same as if it were a chapter, in terms of how it is titled, and the use of page header/footer. But there is a significant exception: If your book design uses header text, you do <i>not</i> write the author and title in headers. Instead, you use <code>\SetVersoHeadText</code> and <code>\SetRectoHeadText</code> to write Foreword, Preface, or Introduction in both. See the example <a href="#h8.3.2.10">Author's Note</a>, below, for how this is done.</p>
<p>A Foreword or Preface is often signed at the end by its writer, with place and date. A lengthy Foreword might instead place its writer's name and credentials under the Foreword title.</p>

<p>Most fiction doesn't need acknowledgements. Don't write Acknowledgements just because you can. Acknowledgements are for those who provided real assistance. If you want to provide a shout-out to your friends for their encouragement, consider doing it on a web page.</p>
<p>If you have a Preface or Author's Note, you can often include acknowledgements there (if you wish), rather than in separate Acknowledgements.</p>
<p>If styled like a chapter, in a book that has page headers, the verso and recto head text is set to Acknowledgements, not the author and title. See the Author's Note, below, for how this is done.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.10">8.3.2.10. Author's Note</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.10">
<p class="noindent">If you use an Author's Note, it begins recto. If very short, style it as a <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>, possibly even using limited text width (as with an Epigraph, above). Otherwise, it is a <a href="#h8.3.1.2">Chapter-Like Section</a>.</p>
<p>An Author's Note directly addresses the reader, from the author. It is often signed with name, place, and date at the end. There is no particular content. Some authors point out that a particular element of the story, which seems fictional, is actually based on a real historical event. Others babble their life stories, and how they came to write the book. Others use it as a catch-all, including acknowledgements and whatever else fits.</p>
<p>There is some wiggle room regarding whether the Author's note is fact or fancy. For example, in the "lost manuscript" genre, authors may (fictionally) tell how the manuscript came into their hands; but a lengthy tale of discovery is better placed in main matter, as a fictional Introduction.</p>
<p>If an Author's Note is two pages long, then on the second page use the same page style that you would ordinary use to start a chapter. Normally, this is <code>\thispagestyle{footer}</code>.</p>
<p>If an Author's Note is three or more pages long, then a header is permitted (if the book's main style has header). You may allow author and title to appear in header text, but it is better to indicate that this is <em>not</em> the main story, using <code>\SetVersoHeadText{Author's&nbsp;Note}</code> and <code>\SetRectoHeadText{Author's&nbsp;Note}</code>.</p>

<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.11">
<p class="noindent">A Map is a <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>, which may be verso or recto. You may use more than one Map, but be aware that in the printing technology available to you via <i>novel</i> class, a single Map cannot be continued as a spread across the spine; you must break it into two independent Maps, allowing for the inner margins.</p>
<p>Many works of fiction have a map or other diagram. It might be the map of a real or fictional geographic area. It might be the map of a crime scene. It might be an inheritance chart. Even though fictional, it is usually placed in front matter, presumably because a map does not actually tell any part of the story.</p>
<p>I have seen maps placed very early, or very late, in front matter. The general rule seems to be, "put it where it fits." However, do not place a map where some other item <i>must</i> be located, and do not place a map on the final verso that faces the beginning of main matter, due to its visual distraction.</p>
<p>A single map, or maybe two, need not be mentioned in a table of contents or illustrations. If you have a lot of them strewn around the book, then they should be listed in such a table; but this is very rare in fiction.</p>
<p>As with all images, a map must be placed using <i>novel's</i> own <a href="#h7">image placement methods</a>.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.12">8.3.2.12. Second Half-Title</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.12">
<p class="noindent">In many cases, front matter has very little content. After the Copyright Page, there is nothing else to say. But it is visually bad practice to go directly from verso Copyright Page to the start of the story on recto page 1. This can be solved by repeating the Half-Title as recto page <i>v</i>, with blank verso page <i>vi</i>. I've seen it with major writers and major publishers.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing with longer front matter, if it would otherwise end on a verso page.</p>
<p>When there is a lot of front matter (no particular amount), it is customary to use a second Half-Title to mark the boundary where front matter finally ends.</p>
<p><i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> recommends that a second Half-Title be the first page of main matter. Thus, it would be page 1, with the actual story beginning on page 3. But it acknowledges that a <i>common practice</i> is for a second Half-Title and its verso to remain part of front matter, so that main matter begins with the story on page 1. Although I have seen a few books that follow the <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> recommendation, it appears that the great majority of them follow the <i>common practice</i>.</p>
<p>If your book has <a href="#h8.3.3.2">Part Separators</a> in main matter, then you can do without a second Half-Title.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.2.13">8.3.2.13. Final Page of Front Matter</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.2.13">
<p class="noindent">The final page of front matter is always verso. It is almost always blank. The easiest way to insert a blank page is to write <code>\cleartorecto</code> at the end of the preceding recto page.</p>
<p>Why is the final page of front matter almost always blank? It is because it faces the opening page of the main story, and you don't want to show anything that detracts from the scene or mood. But there are exceptions. For example, an Epigraph might usefully contribute to the setting. Or, in the case of an old-style English murder mystery (where you already know that the murderer did it with arsenic to inherit the family estate), a map of the estate, or a family tree, would not detract from the setting. The choice is yours.</p>

<h4 id="h8.3.3">8.3.3. Main Matter</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.3.3">
<p class="noindent">Main matter begins with the <code>\mainmatter</code> command. It forces its page to recto, changes the page numbering to Arabic, and sets the count to 1.</p>
<p>Main matter is <i>the story itself</i>. In some cases, this also includes a fictional setup (Introduction or Prologue) that leads to the longer story line. It also includes material in the aftermath of the story, such as Epilogue, Conclusion, and end notes.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.3.1">8.3.3.1. Half-Title in Main Matter ?</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.3.1">
<p class="noindent">The <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> prefers that a second Half-Title page (if used) mark the beginning of main matter. Thus, it would be page 1 (number not printed). Then, the story begins on page 3.</p>
<p>However, <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> also notes that this is not the regular practice, especially with fiction. In fact, among the many popular fiction books I have inspected, when a second Half-Title is used, it is <i>almost</i> always the last recto page of front matter, followed by a blank verso; then main matter begins with page 1 of the story.</p>
<p>The choice is yours. I suggest agreeing with regular practice: If you use a second Half-Title, keep it in front matter.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.3.1 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.3.2">8.3.3.2. Part Separator in Main Matter</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.3.2">
<p class="noindent">If used, a Part Separator is a recto <a href="#h8.3.1.1">Display Page</a>.</p>
<p>Some books are partitioned into distinct sub-books. A sub-book is of substantial length, not individual chapters or short stories.</p>
<p>If your book has distinct sub-books, then each of them has its own recto cover page, known as a Part Separator. Its verso is blank or an Epigraph. Then the accompanying story begins recto.</p>
<p>A Part Separator is <i>always</i> main matter. So, the first Part Separator is <i>always</i> page 1 (number not printed). Then its text begins on page 3. Do not re-initialize the page count when you get to the next Part Separator.</p>
<p>Part separators could be simply <i>Part I</i>, <i>Part II</i>, and so forth. They could be <i>Book I</i>, <i>Book II</i>. Or, they could have distinctive titles, such as <i>The Northern Front</i> and <i>The Southern Front</i>. If your book is two novelettes in one, then the Part Separators would be the title (and subtitle, if any) of the individual novelettes. Sometimes a Part Separator has a brief description of its purpose, as in <i>Book I. On Earth</i> followed by <i>Book II. On Mars</i>.</p>
<p>Unless your book has a very complex structure, do <i>not</i> use both a second Half-Title (whether in front matter or main matter) and a Part Separator. Combine them as the recto main matter page 1: <i>The Withens Chronicles. Part I</i>, or simply <i>Part I</i>. Then the next Part Separator would be <i>Part II</i>.</p>
<p>In one book I recently noticed, there were five parts, each of which corresponded to one calendar day. The Part Separator showed the day, as in <i>Monday, September 25</i>. Then within each part there were several chapters, each of which took us to some different event in a different setting, all on that same day. I also note that this book had no Table of Contents; the progress of the novel was therefore a surprise, by its author's intent.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.3.3">8.3.3.3. Introduction in Main Matter</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.3.3">
<p class="noindent">An Introduction is a <a href="#h8.3.1.2">Chapter-Like Section</a>. If the book is nonfiction and the Introduction is factual, it belongs in front matter, as described above. But in fiction, where an Introduction is a fictional lead-in to the larger story, it belongs in main matter.</p>
<p>A main matter Introduction is typically used in the "lost manuscript" genre, where some fictional adventurer or archaeologist describes how the manuscript was found and translated. Often, the narration is a moderately lengthy adventure tale, told in the first person, by some adventurer or achaeologist. Following such an Introduction, the various chapters will reveal the contents of the manuscript. If the voice of the Introduction returns at the end, it is called a Conclusion, and is in main matter.</p>
<p>If an Introduction is in main matter, its header text (if any) is whatever is used throughout the main story. Typically that's author verso, title recto. The reason is that such an Introduction is actually part of the overall story.</p>

<p>The purpose of a Prologue is to provide a quick lead-in or setting for the story, and get the reader's attention. It is confined in place and time (one scene, one perspective). The narrator may be first-person or third-person.</p>
<p>Do not use a Prologue for the voice of the author speaking about the book, as author; that goes in front matter, as an <a href="#h8.3.2.10">Author's Note</a>.</p>
<p>If a book has a Prologue, then it is likely to have an Epilogue after the main story ends. An Epilogue also belongs in main matter.</p>
<p>I do not know of any fiction with both a fictional Introduction and a Prologue. If so, Introduction precedes Prologue.</p>
<p>Note: I have seen some web pages advising that a Prologue should go in front matter, and be narrated by a character who appears in the following story. Based on <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> and actual books, I do not think that is correct.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.3.4 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.3.5">8.3.3.5. Chapters</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.3.5">
<p class="noindent">Finally, you have arrived at Chapter One! Not surprisingly, it is a <a href="#h8.3.1.2">Chapter-Like Section</a>. Chapter One is always recto, whether or not preceded by an Introduction or Prologue.</p>
<p>Subsequent chapters may begin recto or verso. Or, the book may be designed so that each chapter always begins recto. In the majority of novels I have seen, recto/verso is used. The <code>\clearpage</code> command starts a new page (recto or verso), and the <code>\cleartorecto</code> command will (if necessary) insert a blank verso, so that the following material is always recto.</p>
<p>In the case of short stories, especially if they are by different authors, it is customary to begin each one as recto.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.3.5 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.3.6">8.3.3.6. Epilogue, Conclusion</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.3.6">
<p class="noindent">If your book has an Epilogue or Conclusion, it begins recto as a <a href="#h8.3.1.2">Chapter-Like Section</a> in main matter.</p>
<p>An Epilogue is structurally like a Prologue, but tells the aftermath of the story. A Conclusion is like an Introduction, in which we step outside the main story. I am not aware of any book that has both; but if so, Epilogue precedes Conclusion.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.3.6 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.3.7">8.3.3.7. End Notes, Appendix, etc.</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.3.7">
<p class="noindent">If used, End Notes begin recto, as a <a href="#h8.3.1.2">Chapter-Like Section</a> in main matter. The same applies to an Appendix and like material.</p>
<p>Page numbering continues Arabic. It may surprise you to learn that this is still main matter, but <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> says so, and that's what was done in the few fictional books that have them, among those I have seen.</p>
<p>The reason is that this kind of material, which is fictional, is actually the original author's writing, entwined with the main story. It was always intended to be part of the book. Never mind that it "looks like" academic material added later.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.3.7 -->
</div><!-- end 8.3.3 -->

<h4 id="h8.3.4">8.3.4. At Very End</h4>
<div class="d4" id="d8.3.4">
<p class="noindent">In <i>novel</i>, you must always end your document this way:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\cleartoend<br/>
\end{document}
</code></p>
<p>The final page of your book is necessarily verso. P.O.D. printers (and many others) require that it be completely blank, because they will add some manufacturing information to that page. So, if the text of your book finishes on a recto page, <code>\cleartoend</code> adds one blank page. But if the text finishes on a verso page, then <code>\cleartoend</code> adds <em>two</em> blank pages, so that the final page is blank verso.</p>

<h5 id="h8.3.4.1">8.3.4.1. Backmatter? Not!</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.4.1">
<p class="noindent">
Once upon a time, when printing was not so electronically automated, it was difficult to add material to the end of a previously-typeset section of front matter. So, if there was a subsequent printing of the book, with new material that ought to go in front matter, the problem was solved by placing the new material in "back matter." Then, the original pagination did not have to be altered. To stress that the added material was not part of the original, it would have non-Arabic page numbering, which might be a continuation of lowercase roman numerals from where the front matter left off, or might begin with uppercase Roman numerals.</p>
<p>A similar situation applied to critical editions of earlier works, which added material from different authors. The added material was never part of the original book.</p>
<p>That is a situation you are never likely to address. When most authors speak about "back matter," what they mean is explanatory material that follows the end of the story. That is, anything after the final Chapter, Epilogue, or Conclusion. A good example can be found in J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Return of the King,</i> which has quite a bit of material following the end of the story. That material discusses the language and history of the Elves, and a variety of other things. But its page numbering continues Arabic. It looks like critical commentary, but it is part of Tolkien's original, fictional structure for the book. Thus, it is main matter.</p>
<p>So, your book is unlikely to have true back matter. If you use the <code>\backmatter</code> command, it does nothing. If you really wish to change page numbering, then you must code it manually. This is not advised for P.O.D. books, as it may confuse someone performing quality inspection; true back matter is so rare.</p>
</div><!-- end 8.3.4.1 -->

<h5 id="h8.3.4.2">8.3.4.2. About the Author</h5>
<div class="d5" id="d8.3.4.2">
<p class="noindent">A hardcover book often has "About the Author" on the inside flap of its dust jacket. Softcover doesn't have a dust jacket, so one strategy is to add a leaf after the story finishes (but before <code>\cleartoend</code>) and place "About the Author" on its recto. That avoids repagination of the original. It is still treated as main matter, with continued (non-printing) Arabic page number. Thus:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
.. and they rode off into the sunset. % end of story<br/>
\cleartorecto<br/>
\thispagestyle{empty}<br/>
\begin{ChapterStart}<br/>
\ChapterTitle{About the Author}<br/>
\end{ChapterStart}<br/>
Dirk Hardcase is a former... etc.\par<br/>
\cleartoend<br/>
\end{document}
</code></p>
<p>&bull; I suggest that if you wish to tell about yourself, you can put it on a web site instead, where you can easily edit or delete it.</p>

<h2 id="hA">Appendix A. <img src="html-resources/amb.png" width="30" height="22" alt="emergency icon"/> Emergency Clinic: Rework Layout</h2>
<div class="d2" id="dA">
<div style="padding: 6px 0px 6px 0px; margin:0px 32px 6px 16px; background:#ffe7e7 none">
<p class="noindent">Situation: Your book is designed for Trim Size 5.25x8, one of several widely-used American sizes. You have put many hours of work into getting just the right line breaks within paragraphs, and just the right pagination. It looks beautiful. But then you get an e-mail from a British distributor. Could you change to British size B novel format, essentially 5.06x7.81 Trim Size?</p>
<p>Sure, you say. Just needs a little math. Knock 0.095" off each margin. What could be easier? So you try that, but the printer rejects your file. It seems that your original margins were as narrow as they could be, per the printer's specifications. You cannot make them any narrower.</p>
<p>But if you re-size the book and don't knock the margins down, then the text width and height won't be the same. Your text doesn't fit the way it used to. All your lines re-flow, the page breaks are different, and all that work you put into getting just the right appearance must be re-done.</p>
<p><em>Oh, nooooo ...</em></p>
</div>
<p>Relax. Here is all you need to do: add <code>\ReworkTrimSize{5.06in}{7.81in}</code>. That's it. Your existing margins will be preserved. The font size, and line skip, will be cleverly re-scaled to fit the new dimensions. Paragraphs and pagination are the same as before.</p>
<p>There are two Rework commands available. One changes the Trim Size without changing the margins. The other changes the margins without changing the Trim Size. If you wish to change both Trim Size and margins, you may use both commands.</p>

<h3 id="hA.1">A.1. <code>\ReworkTrimSize{<em>width</em>}{<em>height</em>}</code></h3>
<div class="d3" id="dA.1">
<p>This command changes the <em>existing</em> Trim Size. If you do not use the <code>\SetTrimSize</code> command, then the existing Trim Size is the default. But if you do use <code>\SetTrimSize</code>, then you must leave that command as-is, and place <code>\ReworkTrimSize</code> later in the Preamble.</p>
<p>If you used <code>\SetMediaSize</code>, you may leave that command as-is, or change it if you wish; the Trim Size does not care.</p>
</div><!-- A.1 -->

<h3 id="hA.2">A.2. <code>\ReworkMargins{<em>top</em>}{<em>outside</em>}{<em>bottom</em>}{<em>inside</em>}</code></h3>
<div class="d3" id="AF.2">
<p>This command changes the <em>existing</em> margins. If you do not use the <code>\SetMargins</code> command, then the existing margins are the defaults. But if you do use <code>\SetMargins</code>, then you must leave that command as-is, and place <code>\ReworkMargins</code> later in the Preamble.</p>
</div><!-- end A.2 -->

<h3 id="hA.3">A.3. Example of Rework</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dA.3">
<p>Here is an example of the Rework commands in use. When the layout is reworked, the font size and (if necessary) baseline skip is scaled to fit the new dimensions, in a way that preserves the original paragraphs and pagination. This is done in a single pass: The method simultaneously works and re-works the layout.</p>
<p>In the following example, the original font size is 11pt, and the baselineskip (calculated based on other factors) is 14.377pt. After rework, the font size is automatically re-calculated to 10.468pt, with lineskip 13.883pt.</p>
<p class="code">
<code>\documentclass{novel}<br/>
\SetTrimSize{5.25in}{8in} % Original. American.<br/>
\SetMargins{0.36in}{0.4in}{0.38in}{0.65in} % Original. American<br/>
\ReworkTrimSize{5.06in}{7.81in} % New. Equivalent to British 129mmW x 198mmH.<br/>
\ReworkMargins{12mm}{12mm}{12mm}{15mm} % New. British.
</code></p>
<p>Result with original layout (above Rework commands commented out):</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/originalspread.png" width="726" height="544" alt="original spread, before rework"/></p>
<p>Result after Rework:</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/reworkedspread.png" width="700" height="531" alt="spread after rework"/></p>
</div><!-- end A.3 -->

<h3 id="hA.4">A.4. Limitations of Rework</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dA.4">
<p>&bull; The technique has been tested, but it might not always work. Be sure to inspect the result carefully.</p>
<p>&bull; If you use Rework to make a radical size change, then the resulting font size or line skip might be unattractive.</p>
<p>&bull; If the reworked pages have one less line than expected (or one more), this is due to roundoff in the calculations. It can usually be fixed by adding or subtracting as little as <code>0.001\nbs</code> from the top or bottom rework margin.</p>
<p>&bull; The biggest obstacle occurs when you specify some internal length in terms of absolute units (such as pt). It is always best to use relative units (such as <i>em</i>, or sometimes <code>\nbs</code>), so that they can be scaled along with the text:</p>
<p class="code">
Bad: <code>\hspace{6pt}</code> &nbsp; Good: <code>\hspace{0.5em}</code><br/>
Bad: <code>\kern1pt</code> &nbsp; Good: <code>\kern.08em</code><br/>
Bad: <code>\vspace{0.5in}</code> &nbsp; Good: <code>\vspace{2.4\nbs}</code>
</p>
<p>&bull; When you use Rework, images are <em>not</em> scaled. Thus, they will have a different relationship to the surrounding text than they did before. In many cases, this is not a problem. However, an un-scaled image may disrupt the flow of text, or the number of lines in a page, or overlap text that was previously cleared. Look in the log file for an Alert message, which suggests an appropriate image scale, depending on how an image was placed. Problem areas can often be fixed be scaling the related image(s) in an external graphics program (see below, and also <a href="#h7">section 7</a>) then re-compiling with the scaled image(s).</p>
<p>&bull; Note that you may see the Alert whether or not there are problem images, so scaling images will not make the Alert go away. It is a friendly message.</p>
<p>&bull; Drop Caps are somewhat problematic, because they are enlarged using both baseline skip and font size. You will still have drop caps after rework, but the location of line breaks may change. In worst case, the paragraph will have an extra line (or one elss), and that will affect subsequent pagination.</p>
<p>There are two ways to fix that issue: (1) If you created the drop caps using <code>\dropcap</code> command, try using its <code>bloat</code> key to stretch or shrink the letter horizontally. This does not affect images. (2) Locally change the height of the <i>ChapterStart</i> environment, using its optional argument.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div><!-- end A.4 -->

<h3 id="hA.5">A.5. Scaling Images after <code>\Rework</code>.</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dA.5">
<p>When you use one or both of the Rework commands, the font size and/or the baselineskip will change. However, it does not scale images. In many cases, there is no problem. But in some cases, an un-scaled image will disrupt the previous flow of text or pagination. If you look in the log file, you will see an Alert message, which suggests (only suggests) appropriate values for scaling problem images, depending on whether they are placed inline or block. Then, you should re-work the image in an external image editor. When you scale the image, be sure that the revised version is at the correct resolution of 300dpi or 600dpi, or whatever is necessary.</p>
<p>It is best to go back to your copy of the original artwork, before you exported it to <i>png</i> or <i>jpg</i>. But what if you do not have anything but the 1-bit or grayscale images that you created earlier? Then do this (in GIMP):</p>
<p>(1) If the image is 1-bit, change to Color&gt;Mode grayscale.</p>
<p>(2) Use Image&gt;Scale Image to get new dimensions, at 600 or 300 pixels per inch. Careful: Sometimes when you change size, it auto-changes resolution, or vice-versa. Click back and forth in the dialog box, to ensure that both the dimensions and resolution are correct. Use Cubic interpolation or better.</p>
<p>(3) Change View to something that puts the image at its approximate print size.</p>
<p>(4) If desired, play with Filters&gt;Enhance&gt;Sharpen.</p>
<p>(5) Image&gt;Flatten.</p>
<p>(6) If the image is to be 1-bit line art, then use GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick as described in <a href="#h7.2.1">section 7.2.1</a>.</p>
<p>(7) If the image is to be grayscale, export as png, then use GraphicsMagick or Image Magick as described in <a href="#h7.2.2">section 7.2.2</a>.</p>
<p>The above does not take too much time, and will provide superior results. Note that when an image is placed within text, the calculation for text positioning is different than the calculation for image positioning. It is possible (although unlikely) that a <code>\Rework</code> situation will cause an unexpected page break, due to roundoff error in the placement of the final line on a page. This can be fixed by subtracting (or, in some cases, adding) as little as <code>\vspace{-0.001\nbs}</code> before or after the re-scaled image.</p>

<p class="noindent1">You can use six pages, provided that:</p>

<div id="pageC" class="page">


<h2 id="hC">Appendix C. &nbsp; Shopping for Fonts</h2>
<div class="d2" id="dC">
<p class="noindent1">Since the <i>novel</i> class uses only <i>LuaLaTeX</i> and <i>fontspec</i> with utf-8 encoding, you may use any Open&nbsp;Type or TrueType font, subject to licensing. You are not limited to TeX fonts.</p>
<p>Many TeX fonts are only available in older Type 1 format (PostScript). Use of such fonts is <i>strongly discouraged</i>, due to possible issues in <i>novel</i> class (which will not be fixed, if they appear).</p>
<p>In some other cases, a TeX font package provides both the older format, and a newer Open&nbsp;Type or TrueType format. The different formats will have different font names. Sometimes the difference is very slight. Carefully look at the font name for the Open&nbsp;Type format, using TrueType only as a second choice. Remember that most on-line discussions will refer to the older Type 1 PostScript fonts, simply because they have been around longer. For example: <i>Linux&nbsp;Biolinum</i> is a sans-serif font available via TeX as a PostScript font. But <i>Linux&nbsp;Biolinum&nbsp;O</i> (note the O) is an Open&nbsp;Type font. If you need this font, then call for <i>Linux&nbsp;Biolinum&nbsp;O</i>, not simply <i>Linux&nbsp;Biolinum</i>.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Do not attempt to load a font by the <code>\RequirePackage</code> or <code>\usepackage</code> commands. Instead, if you choose to use fonts other than the defaults, load them via the <a href="#h4.2">font setting commands</a> described in this documentation. If you attempt to load a font the wrong way, you may get an error message, or the font may quietly fail to load.</p>

<h3 id="hC.1">C.1 &nbsp; Licensing Issues</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dC.1">
<p class="noindent1">Presumably, you are writing your novel for commercial value, and do not intend to give anything away for free. For that reason, avoid any font licensed under the GPL (GNU Public License) unless it has the <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_font_exception">font exception</a> clause. Many TeX fonts, and many non-TeX free fonts, are licensed under GPL, but <i>without</i> the relatively-recent font exception clause. Be careful!</p>
<p>Beware of fonts "free for personal use" from download sites. Your commercial application is not "personal use." Of course, if you like the font, you may purchase its commercial license.</p>
<p>Also beware of fonts generically labeled as "freeware" with no particular designer name. If you don't know who created the font, then how do you know that it can be given away for free? Even if there is a designer name, some of them had second thoughts about "freeware." They intended the fonts to be free only if you give your own work away for free. But they didn't mention it. Maybe they have no legal recourse, but you don't want them making anonymous negative reviews of your book.</p>
<p>You have numerous fonts already installed in your operating system, and perhaps others that came bundled with a particular application. If you intend to use those fonts, carefully read their licenses. It is often the case that fonts bundled with an application may <em>only</em> be used for documents created within, or processed by, that application. Or, the fonts may be OK to use for printing directly by your own home printer, but not for embedding in a PDF that will go to a commercial printer.</p>
<p>Although it does not pertain to TeX, another issue can arise if you later publish an ebook version. Fonts licensed for printing are often not licensed for an ebook. Indeed, the ebook distributor may ban them.</p>
<p>Always look for a Copyright notice, which can be identified with a particular person or organization. Copyright is good! It means that someone is claiming authorship of the font software. Only the Copyright owner has the right to give the font away for free, or license it to you after payment (often through an intermediary).</p>
<p>If you prefer free fonts, the most widely accepted license is the <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL">SIL Open Font License</a>. This allows you to use the font for commercial purposes, embed it in PDF, modify it to suit your needs (if you change the font name), and even re-distribute the modifications. The recommended default <i>Libertinus Serif</i> bears this font license. So does the included font <i>NovelDeco</i>.</p>
</div><!-- end C.1 -->

<h3 id="hC.2">C.2 &nbsp; Technical Issues</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dC.2">
<p class="noindent1">Many fonts have technical errors, even among professional fonts. Some of the errors are so minor that they are not worth fixing.</p>
<p>However, beware of fonts based on traced artwork. The late 1990s had an explosion of amateur dingbat and decorative fonts produced this way, by scanning images from old books and digitizing the scan. The resulting vector glyphs rarely meet standards, and often are quite awful. The problem is that when a commercial printer renders your PDF to print, the printer's software is very different from what you have on your home computer. A technically erroneous glyph might look OK at home, but be rejected commercially.</p>
<p>If you have the knowledge, you can open a font in font editor software (such as <i>FontForge</i>) and ask it for validation. Missing extrema are rarely a problem, even if a lot of them are missing. Self-intersecting glyphs are not a problem if the the glyph is composed of two elements stuck together, such as Ç composed of C with separate cedilla. However, a self-intersecting glyph may be a problem if its lines criss-cross each other. Open paths, and outer paths drawn the wrong way, are often a problem. If the errors are confined to glyphs that you will not be using, then it can pass.</p>
</div><!-- end C.2 -->

<h3 id="hC.3">C.3 &nbsp; Appearance Issues</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dC.3">
<p class="noindent1">There are general expectations for book fonts, in terms of character sizes and shapes, and weights. Many of the widely-used TeX fonts, including Latin&nbsp;Modern, are unacceptable in fiction for this reason. Times&nbsp;New&nbsp;Roman is not quite acceptable for fiction; but it is often mis-used by amateurs with a word processor.</p>
<p>The best way to assess a font is to print it to paper, at actual size. Use an inkjet (not laser) printer with only-black cartridge. In the print-on-demand world, your book is likely to be printed using an industrial-strength inkjet machine. Characters may be not quite as black as you would expect from the offset press technology used for larger-quantity production runs. Also, keep in mind that the paper you use at home is not like the (higher quality) paper that will be used for your book.</p>
<p>Depending on whom you ask for an opinion, fiction is most easily read when there are about 60 to 66 characters (including spaces) per line. To evaluate a font for the main text, print out some paragraphs about 4" to 4.25" wide, and scale the font's point size so that you get an average number of characters per line in that range. Be sure to do that: Adobe&nbsp;Garamond&nbsp;Pro at 12pt, Libertinus&nbsp;Serif at 11.4pt, and Libre&nbsp;Caslon&nbsp;Text at 9.6pt (!) provide about the same number of characters per line of text. At the proper point size, some fonts will look too dark, and others will look too light.</p>
<p>Things to look for: (1) Are the lowercase letters too tall? If they are, then it is hard for readers in many Western languages to find where sentences start, by looking for capital letters. Also, there is less white space between lines, which makes the text appear dense and harder to read. (2) Is the shape of the characters so natural that you don't notice them? That's good! It is your writing, not the font, that is to be noticed. (3) Remember that some fonts are designed for use at large size, in posters; such fonts tend to look mechanical in fiction. Other fonts are designed for computer screens; the letters will be too widely-spaced in fiction. Nearly all modern fonts have decent kerning and important ligatures, so that's not usually a decisive factor.</p>
<p>The prevailing rule: If you notice the font, it's wrong.</p>

<h2 id="hD">Appendix D. &nbsp; The 240% Ink Limit (TAC) Color Gamut</h2>
<div class="d2" id="dD">
<p class="noindent">The <i>gamut</i>, or range of available colors, is not the same for your computer monitor as it is for a printer. Obviously that depends on the technology of your monitor, and the technology of the printer. By and large, a good CMYK commercial printer can provide blue-greens that your monitor cannot accurately display. And, your monitor might display purple-violet colors that cannot accurately be printed. The monitor's advantage in purple-violet largely disappears for inexpensive LCD flat panels, which is what most of us have.</p>
<p>However, the full CMYK gamut is only realized when each ink channel can act independently. That is, each spot on the paper must be able to retain as much as a full dose of each ink. At 0%-100% ink per channel, a spot of paper would have to hold up to 400% ink. For a variety of reasons, most printing technologies cannot apply that much ink. Or rather, if they did try to apply that much, the resulting print might smear, fail to dry, lift off, or soak through to the opposite side of the paper. Subsequent lamination might fail to adhere.</p>
<p>Quality books and magazines, using coated paper, can typically hold 300%-360% ink (the technical name is TAC, Total Area Coverage). However, the color cover of a print-on-demand book might be produced by a method that holds less ink. The operative word is "might." Common P.O.D. printers are industrial-strength inkjet machines, capable of very high quality when used with suitable paper. The print job will be sent out on a copy-by-copy basis to any number of different print shops, who may use other technology. Therefore, P.O.D. services may require that the color gamut be limited to those printable by a "lowest common denominator" process. One widely-used "lowest common denominator" is 240% ink limit.</p>
<p>At 240% ink limit, brightly colored areas are generally unaffected. Deep, rich colors cannot be produced, since they would require too much ink. You will be required to provide an image with colors that fit within the ink limit, or the P.O.D. service may quietly alter your image for you.</p>
<p>Print simulation, or <i>softproofing</i>, is a method of viewing an image on your computer, "as if it were printed" to some standard. GIMP can do this, as long as you provide the necessary *.icc color profile for the printer. Then you can decide whether or not the result is acceptable. The actual CMYK image is produced by the methods described in <a href="#h7.4">section 7.4</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hD.1">D.1. &nbsp; Example: Bright Colors Preserved</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dD.1">
<p>Below is a painting from the Middle Ages (photo by me) on display at the San Francisco Legion of Honor museum. The photo, at left, is as originally seen on a computer monitor. At right, the image is softproofed using the SWOP 238% ink limit color profile mentioned in Chapter 13. You can see that the brightest blue is about the same, The brightest reds and greens are almost the same. But the images differ in the dark areas. Especially look at the lion's leg (lower left corner) and the writer's hair and beard (right foreground).</p>

</div><!-- end D.1 -->

<h3 id="hD.2">D.2. &nbsp; Example: Natural Light Preserved</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dD.2">
<p>Below is a photograph taken on a dull day along the California coast, near Bixby Creek. Whether in monitor color or softproofed, the results are almost exactly the same. With the exception of some tiny shadowed areas in the foreground (hard to notice), just about everything in the picture can print with not more than 238% ink.</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/bixby-compare.jpg" width="738" height="340" title="Medieval Painting, monitor and softproof" alt="Bixby Creek, monitor and softproof"/></p>
</div><!-- end D.2" -->

<h3 id="hD.3">D.3. &nbsp; Example: Dark, Rich Colors Lost</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dD.3">
<p>The biggest problem occurs when the artwork is naturally dark. That might occur in night scenes, or with dark-skinned humans. For copyright reasons I cannot show you the original image of a painting by Hyacinthe Rigaud, on display in a European museum. But if it is reduced to a map of 256 colors (as with GIF images), you can see the effect. The original, at left, has many rich browns and reddish-browns. When softproofed, those become nearly gray. The original image still is attractive when softproofed, but its muted dark colors might be surprising if you were unaware of the ink limit effect.</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/colormap-brown.jpg" width="674" height="305" title="Medieval Painting, monitor and softproof" alt="Dark color map, monitor and softproof"/></p>
<p>You might wonder why the ink limit caused rich browns to appear <i>darker</i>. That's because a blend of yellow, magenta, and black (with too much ink) was changed to one with much less yellow and magenta, but more black (and not too much ink).</p>

<h2 id="hE">Appendix E. Overview of <i>fontspec</i> Syntax</h2>
<div class="d2" id="dE">
<p class="noindent">Much of what follows is a digested portion of the full <i>fontspec</i> package documentation. There are many more features, and ways to use them, than will be described below.</p>

<h3 id="hE.1">E.1. Font (Family) Name vs. Font File Name</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dE.1">
<p class="noindent">A <em>font file</em> is an individual file, with its own <em>file name</em>, including file extension. For example, libertinusserif-regular.otf and libertinusserif-italic.otf are two different font files. This much is obvious.</p>
<p>A <em>font family name</em>, often merely called <em>font name</em>, refers to one or more font files that are variations of the same basic font. Some fonts are so unique that the family consists of just one file. For example, the <i>NovelDeco</i> font family consists of the one file <i>NovelDeco.otf</i>. Typically, a font family has four files, consisting of Regular, Italic, Bold, and BoldItalic variants. Even though there are four font files, there is a single font family name.</p>
<p>Many font families have more than four files, including Semibold and Light weights, and Condensed tracking. It is up to the font designer to decide whether a Condensed variation of the "Bubble Turble" font should be treated as a member of the "Burble Turble" family, or as a separate "Burble Turble Condensed" family.</p>
<p>The font (family) name can be learned by opening font files in your system font viewer. Currently, the Windows 10 font viewer uses "Font name" and the Ubuntu font viewer puts the font name in more prominent type. A font (family) name may contain more than one word, with or without spaces, and may contain a general classification such as <em>serif</em>, <em>sans</em>, or <em>mono</em>, because those are actually different families. But it will not contain words such as <em>regular</em>, <em>medium</em>, <em>semibold</em>, <em>bold</em>, or <em>italic</em>; those are for individual members of the same family. Within TeX, some of the older PostScript fonts have been re-worked as newer TrueType and Open Type fonts. The family names are slightly different, so pay attention.</p>
<p class="centerimg">

</p>

<h4 id="hE.1.1">E.1.1. Set/New by Font Name vs. File Name</h4>
<div class="d4" id="dE.1.1">
<p class="noindent">When you set an existing font, or create a new font command, you can use either the font (family) name, or the specific font file name. However, there may be a big difference in results!</p>
<p style="margin-top:10px"><b>By family name:</b></p>
<p><img class="floatright" style="padding-top:12px" src="html-resources/fontbyfamily.png" width="338" height="42" alt="font family defined"/> When you use the <em>font family name</em>, you configure all of the Regular, Italic, Bold, and BoldItalic variants. The usual TeX commands will be applied:</p>
<p>Preamble:</p>
<p class="code" style="clear:both"><code>\NewFontFamily\rway{Raleway}</code></p>
<p>Document Body:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\rway I came, \textbf{I saw}, \emph{I conquered}, \textsc{I left}.}</code></p>
<p style="margin-top:10px"><b>By file name:</b></p>
<p><img class="floatright" style="padding-top:12px" src="html-resources/fontbyfilenamei.png" width="335" height="44" alt="font file defined"/> However, if you specify a single <em>font file name</em>, then <em>only</em> that font file will be used, regardless of requests for bold or italic. Small caps will be honored, if the specific file has them:</p>
<p>Preamble:</p>
<p class="code" style="clear:both"><code>\NewFontFamily\rwayi{Raleway-Regular-Italic.otf}</code></p>
<p>Document Body:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\rwayi I came, \textbf{I saw}, \emph{I conquered}, \textsc{I left}.}</code></p>
<p style="margin-top:10px"><b>File Name Combinations:</b></p>
<p><img class="floatright" style="padding-top:12px" src="html-resources/frankenfont.png" width="312" height="41" alt="frankenfont"/> What you write is what you get. You can customize a font family by individually selecting its members. Here is the syntax.</p>
<p>Preamble:</p>
<p class="code" style="clear:both"><code>\NewFontFamily\frankenfont[% note the % at linebreaks<br/>
&nbsp; ItalicFont=BaskervilleF-Italic.otf,%<br/>
&nbsp; BoldFont=libertinusserif-semibold.otf,%<br/>
&nbsp; BoldItalicFont=texgyrepagella-bolditalic.otf,%<br/>
]{Raleway-Medium.otf}</code></p>
<p>Document Body:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\frankenfont I came, \textbf{I saw}, \emph{I conquered}, \textsc{I left}.}</code></p>
<p style="margin-top:10px"><b>Semibold, Light, etc.:</b> The above syntax is especially useful when you wish to specify semibold (if available), rather than bold. It is also a way to select something such as light versions:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\NewFontFamily\rwlight[% note the % at linebreaks<br/>
&nbsp; ItalicFont=Raleway-Light-Italic.otf,%<br/>
&nbsp; BoldFont=Raleway-Medium.otf,%<br/>
&nbsp; BoldItalicFont=Raleway-Medium-Italic.otf,%<br/>
]{Raleway-Light.otf}</code></p>
<p>Note that the font file in braces is the one used as the "regular" font, in this definition.</p>

<h3 id="hE.2">E.2. Open Type Features</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dE.2">
<p class="noindent">Features are variations, contained within a single font file. In the bad old days, when you wanted true small caps, you had to load a separate font file that had them (and did not have ordinary lowercase letters). Now, if an Open Type font file has the <i>smcp</i> feature (most do), you obtain the small caps from within the same file, by asking for them. Requests for the feature may be made on-the-fly, or pre-loaded for global use.</p>
<p>Here are several of the most frequently-used features, relevant to fiction writing. There are many more, and most fonts have only a few of them. Even when a font has a feature, it may be limited to some portion of the characters. For example, it is common for small caps to be available only for Latin-1 letters, even though the font also contains Greek and Cyrillic. To put this another way: The availability of a feature does not tell you its breadth of coverage. Unless the font has documentation showing coverage of its features, the only way to find out is to create and print a test page.</p>

</table>
<p>&bull; Kerning is the automatic adjustment of spacing between letters, so that they fit together nicely. The values are read from tables within the font.</p>
<p>&bull; Common ligatures are substitutions, such as a combined <i>ff</i> character for two consecutive <i>f</i> characters. It is up to the font designer to determine which ligatures, if any, are common.</p>
<p>&bull; TeX ligatures (such as replacing `` with “ and --- with &mdash;) are not actually an Open Type feature, but they are treated that way by the software. All of these are enabled by default. The <i>fontspec</i> manual explains how to disable them, if necessary.</p>
<p>&bull; The SmallCaps feature applies only to lowercase letters; ordinary capitals remain ordinary capitals. UppercaseSmallCaps deals only with converting ordinary capitals to small caps. If you want both, use both. In most fonts that have them, small caps are slightly taller than lowercase, and slightly more widely spaced. What distinguishes real small caps from fake ones (obtained by scaling ordinary capitals) is that the weight and spacing are more compatible with surrounding text.</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/smallcapsrealfake.png" width="478" height="43" alt="real vs fake small caps"/></p>
<p>&bull; Lining numerals are the ones most familiar to you, from math or accounting. They sit on the baseline and have the height of capital letters. That's just right for doing calculations, and is acceptable for things such as page numbers and chapter numbers.</p>
<p>&bull; When lining numerals are mingled with flowing text, they may stand out too much. OldStyle numerals are more like flowing text: Most of the numerals are at lowercase height, with ascenders and descenders. Compare the first number as OldStyle, the second as Lining:</p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/jollybeers.png" width="499" height="52" alt="oldstyle vs lining numerals"/></p>
<p>Most fonts use Lining numerals as their default. A few default to OldStyle numerals. Thus, you should explicitly call for the kind of numerals you wish to use.</p>
<p>&bull; True OldStyle numerals have a flat top on <em>one</em>, and a very round <em>zero</em>: <img src="html-resources/10trueold.png" width="37" height="13" alt="true oldstyle 10"/> This may be a bit distracting. Some fonts use a transitional form, where the one has a tilted top (like big 1) and the zero is not so round: <img src="html-resources/10transold.png" width="37" height="13" alt="transitional oldstyle 10"/> Others offer you a choice, via an Open Type "style set." See the <i>fontspec</i> manual for how to code style sets.</p>
<p>&bull; There are many more Open Type features, most of which are not useful in ordinary fiction writing. Fonts rarely have more than a few features. Some features (such as the ones shown above) have a specific meaning. Other features, such as "style sets", have whatever meaning the font designer assigns them; Thus the <i>ss03</i> feature of one font may do something very different from <i>ss03</i> in a different font.</p>

<h4 id="hE.2.1">E.2.1. Scale as Pseudo-Feature</h4>
<div class="d4" id="dE.2.1">
<p class="noindent">Although it is not an Open Type feature, <i>Scale=number</i> may be written like a feature. <i>Scale</i> globally adjusts the size of the font, relative to what it would otherwise be. If a local font size command is also applied, then the result is the compounded value.</p>
<p>If the font will be mingled with other fonts in the same place, Scale can tweak a font so that it does not stand out. If Scale does not exceed 1, then the baselineskip will not be affected. Over 1 risks spreading lines to accomodate the extra size; this should not be done for fonts that will appear in the flowing main text. But over 1 is acceptable for display fonts that do not wrap lines and do not mingle with main text.</p>
<p>Example: <em>Orbitron</em> is a special-purpose font with a mechanical or futuristic look. Its characters are much larger and heavier than would be found in book fonts. If I wish to mingle Orbitron with ordinary text, I might load the font like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\NewFontFace\orbitron[Scale=0.6]{Orbitron} % Preamble</code></p>
<p>Then in the document body, I could use it like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>The message was brief: {\orbitron DIE, EARTHLING.} Captain Withens smiled as he oiled his ray-gun. But ray-guns don't use oil.\par</code></p>
<p class="centerimg"><img src="html-resources/charscaletext.png" width="522" height="63" alt="charscale text"/>
<p>Scale is more often used for fonts that are pre-defined to have a special meaning and location, such as <a href="#h5.1.3.1">chapter titles</a> or <a href="#h4.3.4.2">page headers</a>. There, the font is not mingled with ordinary text, and it is OK to use a larger Scale. Then, it is not necessary to use local font scaling commands each time the font is used.</p>
</div><!-- end E.2.1 -->

<h4 id="hE.2.2">E.2.2. Color and Opacity</h4>
<div class="d4" id="dE.2.2">
<p class="noindent">Even though the <i>fontspec</i> syntax allows you to set <i>Color</i> and <i>Opacity</i> as pseudo-features when you define a font, <em>the novel class blocks these features.</em> If you attempt to set them as features in a font definition, an error will result. The same applies if you attempt to add them, using <code>\addfontfeature</code>. However, you can still make use of grayscale using ordinary, local color commands.</p>
<p>When you use the <a href="#h2.2">graytext</a> class option, you may write text in grayscale, using commands from the included <i>xcolor</i> package. You should only do this for text that is in special locations. For example, if you begin each chapter with a number that is very large, you might wish to make that number gray, so that it does not overpower the main text.</p>
<p>To avoid possible conflicts, the color specification should be chosen from a limited list of names. In order from dark to light: black, blue, violet, darkgray, purple, red, teal, olive, magenta, gray, brown, green, orange, cyan, lightgray, lime, pink, yellow, white. They will all be rendered in <em>shades of gray</em> (of course, black and white will be themselves). You may also choose from this more convenient list: black, gray1, gray2, gray3, gray4, gray5, gray6, gray7, gray8, gray9, white.</p>
<p>If <i>graytext</i> is not chosen as class option, then any color (even white) will be rendered as black.</p>
<p>&bull; Placing light text over a dark background may produce unexpected results in print, even if it looks good in PDF. If you need this effect, it is better to build the text into the background, as a single image.</p>
</div><!-- end E.2.2 -->

<h4 id="hE.2.3">E.2.3. <code>\CreateFontFeature{<em>code</em>}{<em>substitutions</em>}</code></h4>
<div class="d4" id="dE.2.3">
<p class="noindent">Once in a while, a font has a glyph that you would like to use, but it is not included in any of the font's Open Type feature sets. So, how to you grab that particular glyph? For example: One well-known font has a glyph named <em>emdash.alt</em>, which is not as long as the font's ordinary <em>emdash</em> glyph, and looks better in text. Unfortunately, <em>emdash.alt</em> is not in any of the font's style sets. Without some trickery, only a program such as InDesign can grab that glyph.</p>
<p>Thanks to <i>fontspec</i>, <i>novel</i> has the necessary trickery. Command <code>\CreateFontFeature</code> creates a fake Open Type feature code, and assigns your list of substitutions to that code. Use comma-separated entries if there are multiple substitutions. For the case in question:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\CreateFontFeature{myem}{emdash=emdash.alt}</code></p>
<p>The code <i>myem</i> was randomly chosen as something that is not already defined among Open Type feature codes. Once specified, the fake feature may be used in any font definition, such as this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetParentFont[RawFeature=+myem]{Adobe Garamond Pro}</code></p>
<p>Of course, the fake feature has no effect if the font does not have the substitution character.</p>
<p>This technique may be used for more complicated features, but that is beyond the scope of this documentation. See the <i>fontspec</i> manual if you need to do more.</p>
</div><!-- end E.2.3 -->
</div><!-- end E.2 -->

<h3 id="hE.3">E.3. Local Modifications to Open Type Features</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dE.3">
<p class="noindent">If you specify a particular Open Type feature, it will be generally used for that font command. So if you define a new font command with <i>Letters=SmallCaps</i> as a feature (and if the font actually has them), then small caps will be used for that font, whether or not you locally request them with a command such as <code>\textsc</code>.</p>
<p>Often, you can add (or sometimes remove) features on a local basis. For example, suppose that you defined the font without using its <i>ss03</i> style set. You can locally add that feature to some text, using a command that looks like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>{\addfontfeature{<em>which feature</em>} <em>applied to this text</em>}</code></p>
<p>The above code assumes that you are already using the font in that location. You cannot apply <i>ss03</i> from one font to an entirely different font!</p>
<p>See the <i>fontspec</i> documentation for details of <code>\addfontfeature</code>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to changing features locally, you can define different font commands to call the same underlying font, but with different features.</p>
<p>Two ways to accomplish the same thing:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\NewFontFamily\baskf{BaskervilleF}<br/>
\NewFontFamily\baskftab[Numbers=Monospaced]{BaskervilleF} % tnum feature<br/>
\begin{document}<br/>
Some text {\baskftab hello 123} is here.<br/>
Some text {\baskf\addfontfeature{Numbers=Monospaced} hello 123} is here.
</code></p>

<h2 id="hF">F. Drop Caps</h2>
<div class="d2" id="dF">
<p class="item">A <i>drop cap</i> is an enlarged letter (or image) at the beginning of chapter text, with the first few lines of text wrapped around it:</p>

<h3 id="hF.1">F.1 Built-In Method vs. Lettrine</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dF.1">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> In <i>novel</i>, the built-in <code>\dropcap</code> command is preferred to any other method for creating a drop cap. See the next section for its usage.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> Alternatively, you may load the <i>lettrine</i> package, and use it as described in its own documentation. If <i>lettrine</i> is detected, <i>novel</i> will configure it so that lines remain on grid, and are not pushed down.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> You may use both <code>\dropcap</code> and <code>\lettrine</code> in the same document, as they are independent, and use different settings.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> In <i>novel</i>, the <code>\lettrine</code> command does not accept an image. Use <code>\dropcap</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> Only <i>lettrine</i> offers the rarely-used <i>slope</i> feature.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> Both <code>\dropcap</code> and <code>\lettrine</code> are incompatible with <code>\FirstLine</code>. If you need to set the entire first line in small caps, you are more likely to be successful using <code>\dropcap</code> as described below.</p>
</div><!-- end F.1 -->

<h3 id="hF.2">F.2. \dropcap[<em>options</em>]{<em>letter or image</em>}</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dF.2">
<p class="noindent">To ensure that this command works as described here, verify that font <i>NovelDeco.otf</i> is at least version 1.48. If you use your own <i>deco font</i>, be sure that it is based on at least that version. Also, clear <i>luatex-cache</i> so that the version is updated. If you do not do that, the <code>\dropcap</code> command still works, but the appearance of the result will differ.</p>
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <code>\dropcap</code> command is based on <i>lettrine</i> technology, but has different options and behavior.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The <code>\dropcap</code> command accepts the following options as <span style="white-space:nowrap">comma-separated</a> key values:</p>
<p class="code"><code>lines=<em>integer</em></code> &nbsp; Number of lines indented by the drop cap. Default 3.</p>
<p class="code"><code>gap=<em>length</em></code> &nbsp; Distance from drop cap to indented text. Default 0.25em. (note 1)</p>
<p class="code"><code>hoffset=<em>length</em></code> &nbsp; Moves drop cap horizontally. Default 0em.</p>
<p class="code"><code>voffset=<em>length</em></code> &nbsp; Moves drop cap vertically. Default 0em.</p>
<p class="code"><code>ante={<em>text</em>}</code> &nbsp; Precedes drop cap with normal text. Default empty. (notes 2,4)</p>
<p class="code"><code>ante*={<em>text</em>}</code> &nbsp; Like <code>ante={<em>text</em>}</code> but auto-hangs text in left margin. (notes 3,4)</p>
<p class="code"><code>scale=<em>number</em></code> &nbsp; Scales drop cap letter (not image). Default 1.</p>
<p class="code"><code>bloat=<em>number</em></code> &nbsp; Horizontally scales drop cap letter (not image). Default 1. (note5)</p>
<p class="code"><code>depth=<em>integer</em></code> &nbsp; Adds blank line(s) beneath drop cap baseline. Default 0. (note 6)</p>
<p><img src="html-resources/dropcap-gap.png" class="floatright" width="82" height="150" title="dropcap gap" alt="dropcap gap"/>&bull; Note 1: The <code>gap</code> is equivalent to <i>lettrine's</i> <code>findent</code>. There is no equivalent to <code>nindent</code> or <code>slope</code>. If you wish to move the first line of text closer to the drop cap, use <code>\kern</code> or <code>\hspace</code> there.</p>
<p>&bull; Note 2: <code>ante</code> is typically used for placing quotation mark before the drop cap. But the authoritative <i style="cursor:help" title="Chicago Manual of Style">CMoS</i> recommends that such an opening mark be omitted, at least in American style. If the mark is placed, it is at normal text font, size, and position (this is the style used).</p>
<p><img src="html-resources/dropcap-antestar.png" class="floatright" width="110" height="102" title="ante*=``" alt="ante*=``"/>&bull; Note 3: <code>ante</code> begins at the margin, and thus pushes the drop cap to the right. With <code>ante*</code> its text hangs in the left margin, so that the drop cap is aligned with the margin. This is visually better, providing that you have enough margin to accomodate the ante text. Setting an <a href="#h4.3.1.2">unsafe zone</a> may be helpful.</p>
<p>Example at right: <code>\dropcap[ante*=``]{O}</code></p>
<p>&bull; Note 4: You may use <code>\charscale</code> to manipulate the size and position of ante text. No other styling (such as font or color) may be applied. The ante text will always be black, in the main font. This is standard.</p>
<p><img src="html-resources/dropcap-scalebloat.png" class="floatright" width="98" height="107" title="scale=1.2,bloat=.75" alt="scale=1.2,bloat=.75"/>&bull; Note 5: <code>bloat</code> multiplies <code>scale</code> horizontally. If you use both scale and bloat, they multiply horizontally. The primary use of <code>bloat</code> is to tweak where the lines break, by making the drop cap slightly narrower or thicker.</p>
<p>Example at right: <code>\dropcap[scale=1.2,bloat=0.75]{O}</code>.</p>
<p>&bull; Note 6: If the drop cap character has a prominent descender, then you may need to create room underneath it using <code>depth</code>, or the descender wil intrude into the text beneath it. This can only be decided on a per-character basis, depending on the font.</p>
<p class="item"><img src="html-resources/I-shade.png" class="floatright" width="84" height="88" title="dropcap I image" alt="dropcap I image"/><b>C.</b> An image is auto-detected by file extension png, PNG, jpg, JPG, jpeg, or JPEG. It will be aligned so that its bottom is at the lowest indented baseline. You may position the image using the <code>hoffset</code> and <code>voffset</code> option keys. The image cannot be scaled by <code>hscale</code> or <code>vscale</code>, because it must be at exact size and resolution. Thus, whether or not the image's top aligns in the desired location, depends on how you created the image.</p>
<p>Example at right: <code>\dropcap[voffset=-0.15em]{I-shade.png}</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> If <code>lines=1</code>, then <code>\dropcap</code> has no effect. This applies whether or not the command or <code>ante</code> is starred. That is, the following lines of code have the same result:</p>
<p class="code"><code>&ldquo;It was dark and stormy,&rdquo; he said.</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\dropcap[<i>any keys</i>,lines=1,ante*=&ldquo;]{I}t was dark and stormy,&rdquo; he said.</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> When the drop cap is a letter (not image) without scale, or with <code>scale=1</code>, its top will lie at the capital X-height of main text. This is the most commonly-used style. If the letter has upper diacritical mark, then the mark will be set higher.</p>
</div><!-- end F.2 -->

<h3 id="hF.3">F.3. \dropcap*[<em>options</em>]{<em>letter</em>} &nbsp; starred version</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dF.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> <img src="html-resources/Iboxcap.png" class="floatright" width="84" height="191" title="starred dropcap and image" alt="starred dropcap and image"/>In its starred form, <code>\dropcap*</code> will place a rectangular box around the drop cap letter (but not image).</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If the letter is in the Latin-1 or Latin Extended A character sets, then the box will ignore any upper diacritical mark, so that the mark sits above the box.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The boxed letter is a convenient reference frame, in case you wish to create an image of the letter in a graphics program. If you do that, then you will probably need to apply some negative <code>voffset</code> to the image. You may also wish to kern the first line closer to the image.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Example: At right, the top section shows a drop cap I with box. This portion of the PDF was imported to a graphics program, and the boxed area was used as template for the image shown in the lower section. Then the image was substituted for the original boxed letter.</p>
</div><!-- end F.3 -->

<h3 id="hF.4">F.4. Drop Cap Font and Color</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dF.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> These settings apply to <code>\dropcap</code>, but not <code>\lettrine</code>.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> The default drop cap font is <i>NovelDeco.otf</i> with its Open Type feature <i>dcap</i>. These glyphs are modeled after the <i>Libertinus Serif Display</i> font, and are specially designed to look good at the enlarged size of drop caps, as well as align with the left margin. Also, characters with prominent descenders (such as Ccedilla) are designed so that the descender, rather than the base letter, sits at the baseline. This avoids the need for <code>depth</code> setting.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> To change the font used by <code>\dropcap</code>, you must first define one or more font commands in Preamble. For example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\NewFontFace\mynicedc[<em>features</em>]{font file name}</code></p>
<p>Then, you set the font. This may be changed anywhere:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetDropCapFont{\mynicedc}</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Do not use Type1 or Metafont fonts. If the desired font is only available in one of those formats, you can use a font editor such as <a href="https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/" class="external" rel="external" target="new">FontForge</a> to convert it to Open Type or TrueType format. Then, as described above, load the converted file by its exact file name. If the font has mssing extrema, that is almost never a problem. Overlapped hints are rarely a problem. But self-intersecting glyphs and open paths may be a problem, if you use those glyphs.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> Default drop cap color is black. To change it, use <i>xcolor</i> syntax. Either of these:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetDropCapColor[<em>color model</em>]{<em>color value</em>}</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetDropCapColor{<em>color name</em>}</code></p>
<p>Only grayscale may be used, and the <i>graytext</i> document class option must be enabled.</p>
</div><!-- end F.4 -->

<h3 id="hF.5">F.5. Drop Cap With First Line Small Caps</h3>
<div class="d3" id="dF.5">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> The <code>\FirstLine</code> command does not play well with either <code>\dropcap</code> or <code>\lettrine</code>. This is not a trivial fix.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you require a drop cap to be followed by an entire first line in small caps, Then you must manually code it. You will probably get better results using <code>\dropcap</code> instead of <code>\lettrine</code>.
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> Use <code>\dropcap{letter or image}\textsc{some text} rest of paragraph.</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Guess at how much <code>{some text}</code> needs to be. Compile, look at result, then adjust and try again.</p>
<p class="item"><b>E.</b> It is possible (although unsightly) to end <code>{some text}</code> at a hyphenation point in its final word.</p>
<p class="item"><b>F.</b> Again: There is no known better way to do this.</p>

<h2 id="hNI">News and Issues</h2>
<div class="d2" id="dNI">
<p class="noindent">As versions change, some minor modifications have been made. Whevere existing behavior has changed, it is described here. These changes will affect very few users, if any.<p>
<p>Also provided are known issues (and solutions, if known). Remember that "only compile with lualatex" is not an issue; it is a feature! Also remember that academic-like commands and modes are often disabled in this document class. That is a feature, not an issue.</p>
<p>Issues may be reported at the <a class="external" rel="external" target="new" href="https://github.com/RobtAll/novel">GitHub project page</a> or by e-mail if you don't have a GitHub account. The e-mail address is near the top of the <i>novel.cls</i> file. These may change at some future time.</p>
<p>Before reporting an issue, attempt to compile the file <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>novel-testsuite.tex</i></span>, located in the documentation <i>extras</i> subfolder. Make a copy of that file, and also copy the required image <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>novel-testimage.png</i></span>. Place the copies in your home directory, or some other location where you have read/write privilege. If compile fails, see if your TeX distribution is incomplete or out-of-date.</p>
<p>You may ask for new features, but don't expect any. The <i>novel</i> class is focused on doing one thing well, not several things poorly. That's why several standard LaTeX features are disabled.</p>


<h3 id="hNI.1"><span class="n"></span>NI.1. (Solved) Incorrect string placement with package <i>fmtcount</i></h3>
<div class="d3" id="uNI.1">
<p class="noindent">Solved. See <a href="#h5.4">section 5.4</a>.</p>
</div><!-- end NI.1 -->

<h3 id="hNI.2"><span class="n"></span>NI.2. (Solved) Compile fails after changing default language</h3>
<div class="d3" id="uNI.2">
<p class="noindent">Solved. If you compile a document sucessfully, then re-compile with a different <code>\setdefaultlanguage</code> setting, then compile may fail the second time. It may stop with error message "You can't use \relax after \the."<p>
<p>This depends on which languages are involved. The solution is simple: Discard the <i>*.aux</i> and <i>*.synctex.gz</i> files generated by previous compilation. Then try again.</p>
</div><!-- end NI.2 -->

<h3 id="hNI.3"><span class="n"></span>NI.3. (News, v.1.46) Changed Behavior of \BlockImage</h3>
<div class="d3" id="uNI.3">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Prior to version 1.46, the <code>\BlockImage</code> command measured the height of the image. It also measured the height of optional text that accompanied the image within its block. Unfortunately, the text measurement was unreliable.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> From version 1.46, <code>\BlockImage</code> still measures and clears the height of the image, with subsequent text (not in the same block as the image) on-grid.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> However, the new behavior does <i>not</i> measure the height of optional text that accompanies <code>\BlockImage</code> within its block. If there is too much of it, then it will overflow down into the subsequent text. The subsequent text will not be pushed down or off-grid.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Very few users, if any, will be affected. But if you started a document using <i>novel</i> prior to v. 1.46, and you use <code>\BlockImage</code>, then be sure to review the results.</p>
</div><!-- end NI.3 -->

<h3 id="hNI.4"><span class="n"></span>NI.4. (News, v.1.46.1) Printing This HTML File</h3>
<div class="d3" id="uNI.4">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> With some browsers, you can print this HTML file in the usual fashion. The printout will not show navigation as a right column, Instead, a brief list of contents will appear at the top.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If your user agent has trouble printing, do this: Edit this file, In a UNIX-compatible plain text editor with utf-8. About 83 lines from the top you will see a block of style that is commented out. Remove the comments so that the block is effective. Load the edited HTML file with JavaScript turned off. Then print.</p>
</div><!-- end NI.4 -->

<h3 id="hNI.5"><span class="n"></span>NI.5. (News, v.1.46.1) Default Title and PDF/X Changed</h3>
<div class="d3" id="uNI.5">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Up to, and including version 1.46, the default title was empty, and PDF/X was <i>off</i>:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetTitle{} % old default</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetPDFX{off} % old default</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> From version 1.46.1, the default title is <i>IMPORTANT: Provide Book Title</i>, and PDF/X is enabled (using the most frequent American standard):</p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetTitle{IMPORTANT: Provide Book Title} % new default</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>\SetPDFX[CGATSTR001]{X-1a:2001} % new default</code></p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> You may return to the old behavior by manually setting <b>A</b>. You may change PDF/X to something else. Definitely change the title, unless merely testing.</p>
<p class="item"><b>D.</b> Now, PDF/X is automatically turned off when in draft mode, regardless of your setting. There is also a warning message in the log file.</p> 
</div><!-- end NI.5 -->

<h3 id="hNI.6"><span class="n"></span>NI.6. (News, v.1.46.1) Some Internal Macro Name Changes</h3>
<div class="d3" id="uNI.6">
<p class="item"><b>A.</b> Internal Macros are the kind with <code>@</code> in the name. They are normally hidden from the user, and not documented here.</p>
<p class="item"><b>B.</b> If you have "dived into" the TeX code, and directly used an internal macro: Some of the macro names have changed. You may have to change your own code.</p>
<p class="item"><b>C.</b> The revised names have more consistent style, for the benefit of developers.</p>
