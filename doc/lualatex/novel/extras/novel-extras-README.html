<h2>README for novel extras</h2>

<p>This folder contains items that may be helpful, but are not essential to operation of the <i>novel</i> document class.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-example.tex</i> is a fake short novel. If you wish to compile it, place a copy in your user home folder (or other place where you have read/write privilege) and compile it there. On some operating systems, you cannot compile the original in its <i>extras</i> folder.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-testsuite.tex</i> exercises the various capabilities of the document class. You can look at the code, and see how it compiles. You may also change settings, to see what they do. It requires file <i>novel-testimage.png</i>. If you wish to compile it, place a copy (along with image) in your user home folder (or other place where you have read/write privilege) and compile it there. On some operating systems, you cannot compile the original in its <i>extras</i> folder.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-cover-template.tex</i> may be used for creating a cover, once you have a CMYK image. If you wish to compile it, place a copy in your user home folder (or other place where you have read/write privilege) and compile it there. On some operating systems, you cannot compile the original in its <i>extras</i> folder.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-decoglyphs.pdf</i> shows the decorative characters in the <i>NovelDeco.otf</i> file, along with the codes needed to retrieve them.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-Gallery-ChapterStart.pdf</i> shows a number of different ways to begin a chapter, making use of the ChapterStart environment and related commands.</p>

<p>File <i>CPmodified.otf</i> is not (normally) for use in TeX. I use it when editing my work in a word processor, prior to TeX markup. To use it, install the font in your operating system (not in TeX) where a word processor can find it. This font is nearly-monospaced, with exaggerated punctuation marks. I have found that punctuation errors are most frequently overlooked during editing, since they are so small in many fonts, and the spell-check software doesn't find the errors.</p>
