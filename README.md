# novel
LuaLaTeX document class for fiction, such as novels and short story collections.


## Version

The current stable version is 1.40.2, 2017/09/21. It is available via TeX package managers, or from CTAN. Note that this package is not (yet) distributed in default TeX installations. You have to request it.

The *novel* class requires TeXLive 2016 or later, or recent MiKTeX.


### What's Here

Folders *doc*, *tex*, and *fonts* contain development versions of code that may subsequently be available in an updated version of the package.

The *archive* folder contains one or more zip files of prior stable code. This may be useful if you are in the middle of a project, and a package update causes problems.

The *other* folder may contain material that is not part of the TeX package, but might be useful. In particular, it contains a complete novel, with cover artwork, as source and PDF.


#### Help Wanted

TeX may be long in the tooth, but so am I. Sooner or later I will move on to other things. If you are interested in taking over package maintenance, contact me (and CTAN). You'll need a basic understanding of how things work in commercial printing (especially P.O.D.), familiarity with LuaTeX and especially fontspec, familiarity with Open Type fonts, understanding of PDF/X, and familiarity with the needs of fiction writers. You don't need to know Lua code. You don't need to know any stinking math or physics.
