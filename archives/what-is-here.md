### Archives for the novel document class.

Here you will find one or more zip archives containing a prior (or current) stable version of the novel document class.

This might be useful if you are in the middle of a project, and a package update causes your previously-good code to fail.

Usage: Unzip the desired archive, and install to your TeX local or home folder (not to the distribution folder). The files will over-ride files of the same filename contained in the distribution folder.

Remember to remove these files at some later time. If you do not remove them, then updates to the distribution will be ineffective.
