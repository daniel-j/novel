# THE NOVEL DOCUMENT CLASS

The novel LuaLaTeX document class is specifically written to meet the needs of original fiction writers, who are typesetting their own novels for non-color print-on-demand technology. If that does not describe your objective, then this is the wrong document class for you. There is no support for E-books. The needs of academic writers and picture-book layout are largely unmet.

If your book is a detective novel, science fiction, romance, or collection of short stories, then you are in the right place.

This class requires TeXLive 2016 or later, or recent MiKTeX. Distributions based on TeXLive 2015 or earlier will fail.

## News:

Version 1.38, August 15, 2017. Corrected offset in cover artwork code. Minor improvements to docs.

Version 1.36, August 10, 2017. Minor correction to documentation. Reminds users that dollar is a special character in TeX.

Version 1.34, July 31, 2017. Added some code of interest to developers.

Version 1.32, July 26, 2017. This update contains a minor bug fix to the documentation, and a major bug fix to the way that text tracking is handled. The tracking bug affected page headings (even the defaults) and caused some documents to fail with an obscure MT@res@a error. The fix is expected to be quite solid.

This release has been tested. There are no currently-known bugs (although they may be hiding somewhere). For bug reports, if any, see the e-mail address near the top of novel.cls file.

The original creator of this package would like to transfer maintenance to someone else. If interested, contact CTAN. You will need to be familiar with LuaLaTeX, fontspec, and Open Type fonts, and understand how fiction is presented and printed. Lua coding is not required.
