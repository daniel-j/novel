\ChapterTitle{17. Pepper}
\end{ChapterStart}

I was seated in my chair, back again in this old study. My glance wandered â€™round the room. For a minute, it had a strange, quivery appearance---unreal and unsubstantial. This disappeared, and I saw that nothing was altered in any way. I looked toward the end window---the blind was up.

With a succession of efforts, I trod my way to the window, and looked out. The sun was just rising, lighting up the tangled wilderness of gardens. For, perhaps, a minute, I stood, and stared. I passed my hand, confusedly, across my forehead.

Presently, amid the chaos of my senses, a sudden thought came to me; I turned, quickly, and called to Pepper. There was no answer, and I stumbled across the room, in a quick access of fear. As I went, I tried to frame his name; but my lips were numb. I reached the table, and stooped down to him, with a catching at my heart. He was lying in the shadow of the table, and I had not been able to see him, distinctly, from the window. Now, as I stooped, I took my breath, shortly. There was no Pepper; instead, I was reaching toward an elongated, little heap of grey, ashlike dust....

I must have remained, in that half-stooped position, for some minutes. I was dazed---stunned. Pepper had really passed into the land of shadows.
