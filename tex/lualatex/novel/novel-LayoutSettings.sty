% These are NOT the usual TeX "paper size" choices, such as A4 or letterpaper.
% In the U.S.A., 5.5in W x 8.5in H is very common for softcover fiction,

%% Margins are measured from Trim Size inwards, always positive.
% If the Media Size is larger than Trim Size, then the area beyond

%   lay out the book in a word processor, using a standard (A4 or letter)
%   physical paper size, then you will be asked to set the "margins"
%   very wide, because the word processor margins include both
%   the finished book margins, and the discarded scrap paper.
% In certain circumstances, text or images may intrude into the margin area.
%   This is not an error, because it may be intentional.
% Margins at top and bottom are relative to:

%   bottom of footer, or bottom of textblock if no footer.

%% New in version 1.48: Unsafe Zone (opposite of "safe area").
% This feature only applies with class options `draft,shademargins'
%   and does NOT apply in `coverart'.
% The purpose of margins is to confine the main text (and header/footer).
% In `novel' (unlike most other TeX document classes) there is no provision
%   for marginal notes, because they are not used in popular fiction.
% Yet there may be circumstances where you intentionally or accidentally
%   have text, or part of an image, placed or overflowing into a margin.
% In PDF, even PDF/X, that is not a problem. It cannot read your mind.
% However, every print service specifies a "safe area." All text, and
%   all images without bleed, must remain within the safe area.
% The limits of the safe area are typically 0.125in to 0.5in inside the
%   Trim Size, depending on technology. This defines how close you may
%   place anything near the page edges.
% In `novel' the opposite of the safe area is the "unsafe zone" (UZ).
%   So, the UZ lies just inside the perimeter of the Trim Size.
% Each margin is at least as wide as its corresponding UZ.
%   Some print services use "minimum margin" to mean the UZ.
% When you are in draft mode with `shademargins' class option,
%   the UZ (if it is set) will be displayed in dark gray.
%   Then, you can inspect the PDF for any intrusion into the UZ.
% If you intrude into the UZ, there is no warning or error.
%   The UZ is strictly for visualization. There is no default setting.
%   If you do not set the UZ yourself, then no UZ will be displayed.
% In any case, the final PDF is unaffected.

% PDF Media Size is already known to TeX as \paperwidth and \paperheight.
%   For this reason, there is no need to define additional lengths.
% Sheet-fed printers use a small number of standard paper sizes.
%   Whether you use P.O.D. or print at home or office, your print job will
%   almost certainly be sheet-fed. After printing, the sheet is trimmed
%   to the specified Trim Size. Note that the sheet sizes used in
%   commercial printing are specialized for the purpose, and may be
%   different from the routine A4 and USletter sizes familiar to you.
% In most cases (except for cover artwork), your PDF Media Size will be
%   exactly the same as the finished Trim Size. Placement of the Trim Size
%   onto a larger sheet of paper is done automatically at the print service,
%   a procedure known as "imposition." Several small Trim Sizes may be
%   printed onto a single sheet, in order to waste less paper in trimming.
% In some cases, the print service will ask you to provide a PDF that has
%   the Trim Size placed (usually centered H/V) onto a larger Media Size.
%   Sometimes (especially for cover artwork), that's because you are
%   doing the imposition yourself. In other cases (especially for interiors)
%   it is because most of the files seen at the print service came from
%   word processors, where the writers (not knowing better) created layouts
%   on A4 or USletter with large "margins," rather than correct Trim Size.
%   Then, if you submit a file at actual Trim Size, it looks wrong,
%   not because it is wrong, but because it stands out from the crowd.
% You may use \SetMediaSize to deal with this situation.
% You do not need \SetMediaSize, if (as usual) it is identical to TrimSize.
% Media Size does not have a rework command. If necessary, just change it.
%   Changing the Media Size does not affect Trim Size or internal page layout.
% Class options `cropview' and `closecrop' (only in draft mode)
%   affect Media Size. See their descriptions below.
%
% \SetMediaSize[alignment]{width}{height} usage:
% Optional alignment: center, corner, bottom. Obsolete edge (alias for corner).
%   center (default): Trim is horizontally and vertically centered in media.
%     Preferred by most commercial printers, often home and office as well.
%   corner: Verso Trim at upper left of Media; recto Trim at upper right.
%     Might be useful for making a mock-up copy at home.
%   bottom: Used by some commercial printers, for some cover artwork w/ bleed.

%% Lines Per Page refers to the main textblock, not including header or footer.

%   to avoid crowding of the text and variable line heights.
% The check for constraint is done in file novel-CalculateLayout.sty.

%% DEFINITION OF PARENT AND OTHER FONTS
%% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Prior to v. 1.1, parentfont was known as masterfont. Backwards compatible.
%
% These are the LaTeX defaults, which should already be built-in by now.
% But just in case they are undefined, here they are set to LaTeX defaults:
\providecommand\rmdefault{lmr}
\providecommand\sfdefault{lmss}
\providecommand\ttdefault{lmtt}
% The `no-math' option prevents fontspec from tracking certain font changes.
% This is probably necessary, since novel does some of its own font tracking:
\RequirePackage[no-math]{fontspec} % For LuaLaTeX. NOT package `fontenc'.
\defaultfontfeatures{} % reset
\defaultfontfeatures{SmallCapsFeatures={Renderer=Basic},Ligatures=TeX,}
% Main and sans fonts: kerning, ligatures, and OldStyle numbers if available:
\defaultfontfeatures[\rmfamily,\sffamily]%
  {Kerning=On,Numbers=OldStyle,Ligatures=Common}
% Package `unicode-math' uses Latin Modern Math as default math font:
\RequirePackage{unicode-math}
% A default math font (which presumably you do not need) is chosen here.
% You may over-ride using `unicode-math' \setmathfont in Preamble.
\IfFontExistsTF{Libertinus Math}{
  \setmathfont[BoldFont={libertinusmath-regular.otf}]%
    {libertinusmath-regular.otf}
}{
  \IfFontExistsTF{Latin Modern Math}{}{% Set AtBeginDocument by unicode-math.
  }{ % This hack allows you to proceed without a real math font,
     % (but then you cannot print math):
    \setmathfont[BoldFont={NovelDeco.otf}]{NovelDeco.otf} % fake math feature
    \ClassWarning{novel}{^^JIgnore this if you used \string\setmathfont. ^^J%
     Did not find suitable default math font. Used NovelDeco.otf. ^^J%

%% \CreateFontFeature{substitutions}{feature code}
% Problem: Font has one or more alternate glyphs that you would like to use,
%   but they are not listed in a feature set for the font.
% Solution: Create your own feature set, with \CreateFontFeature. The created
%   feature may then be used like a real feature, in any font definition.
% The substitutions are a comma-separated list, char=char.alt and so forth.
% For example, the following substitutions are syntactically OK:
%   emdash=emdah.alt, one=one.rev, ntilde=ntilde.03
% If a substitution is not available in a particular font, it is ignored.
% You have to look at the font in a font editor, to know what is available.
% It is possible to make silly substitutions, such as a=b, five=three without
%   throwing an error, unless your code causes a cycle.
% The most useful application of this command is to reach alternate emdash,
%   and alternate oldstyle one. Not every font has these.
% The feature code is a 4-character pseudo- Open Type code, otherwise unused.
% For example, the feature code might be myfs (my fake substitution)
%   but it cannot be a pre-defined code such as lnum or smcp. It may be
%   a style set such as ss03 if you are sure that the font in question
%   do not already have ss03 (but this is taking a chance).
% Once defined, you may use it like this (for example):
%   \SetParentFont[RawFeature=+myfs]{fontname}
%   \NewFontFamily\myfake[RawFeature=+myfs]{fontname}
%   In the document body: {\addfontfeature{myfs} text}
