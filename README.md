# novel
LuaLaTeX document class for fiction, such as novels and short story collections.


## Version

The current stable version is 1.46.1, 2017/11/29. There are no known outstanding issues.

If you already have a document using prior code, then review your document for use of the \BlockImage command. The functionality of this command is changed in v. 1.46. See The documentation.

Here at GitHub is experimental code for possible enhancements. Do not use for production.

The *novel* class requires TeXLive 2016 or later, or recent MiKTeX.


### What's Here

Folders *doc*, *tex*, and *fonts* contain development versions of code that may subsequently be available in an updated version of the package.

The *archive* folder contains one or more zip files of prior stable code. This may be useful if you are in the middle of a project, and a package update causes problems.

The *other* folder may contain material that is not part of the TeX package, but might be useful. In particular, it contains a complete novel, with cover artwork, as source and PDF.
