# THE NOVEL DOCUMENT CLASS

The *novel* LuaLaTeX document class is specifically written to meet the needs of original fiction writers, who are typesetting their own novels for non-color print-on-demand technology. If that does not describe your objective, then this is the wrong document class for you. There is no support for E-books. The needs of academic writers and picture-book layout are largely unmet.

If your book is a detective novel, science fiction, romance, or collection of short stories, then you are in the right place. This document class has been used for creating several actual printed novels, both text interior and color cover. Internal code can create PDF/X files for the interior and cover. Furthermore, a color cover image can be separated to CMYK at 240% ink limit, as required by some print-on-demand services.

This class requires TeXLive 2016 or later, or recent MiKTeX. Distributions based on TeXLive 2015 or earlier will fail.

Extensive documentation is in HTML format. The "novel.pdf" file is merely a place-holder.
