# novel
LuaLaTeX document class for fiction, such as popular fiction and short story collections. Not for academic works, graphic novels, or the like.

This document class is optimized for ease of configuration and use, with documents that consist primarily of flowing text. It has been successfully used for multiple print-on-demand books.

The *novel* class requires TeXLive 2016 or later, or recent MiKTeX.


## Version

The current stable version is 1.46.2, 2018/01/14. There are no known outstanding issues.

If you already have a document using prior code, then review your document for use of the \BlockImage command. The functionality of this command is changed in v. 1.46. See The documentation.


## News

March 16, 2018: Version 1.50pre2 for testing

Please test and report, in March 2018. I aim to have the tested version uploaded to CTAN before the end of the month.

The main documentation HTML page has "Appendix Z" describing the most significant changes.

Of particular interest are the image processing scripts, in the "extras" folder.


### What's Here

The *other* folder contains material that is not part of the TeX package, but might be useful. In particular, it contains a complete novel, with cover artwork, as source and PDF.
