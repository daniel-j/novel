<h2>README for novel extras</h2>

<p>This folder contains items that may be helpful, but are not essential to operation of the <i>novel</i> document class. Version 1.50.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-example.tex</i> is a fake short novel. If you wish to compile it, place a copy in your user home folder (or other place where you have read/write privilege) and compile it there.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-testsuite.tex</i> exercises the various capabilities of the document class. You can look at the code, and see how it compiles. You may also change settings, to see what they do. It requires file <i>novel-testimage.png</i>. If you wish to compile it, place a copy (along with image) in your user home folder (or other place where you have read/write privilege) and compile it there.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-decoglyphs.pdf</i> shows the decorative characters in the <i>NovelDeco.otf</i> file, along with the codes needed to retrieve them.</p>

<p>File <i>novel-Gallery-ChapterStart.pdf</i> shows a number of different ways to begin a chapter, making use of the ChapterStart environment and related commands. These are only suggestions.</p>

<p>File <i>CPmodified.otf</i> is not (normally) for use in TeX. I use it when editing my work in a word processor, prior to TeX markup. To use it, install the font in your operating system (not in TeX) where a word processor can find it. This font is nearly-monospaced, with exaggerated punctuation marks. I have found that punctuation errors are most frequently overlooked during editing, since they are so small in many fonts, and the spell-check software doesn't find the errors.</p>

<h3>novel-scripts.zip</h3>
<p>This zip archive contains Windows batch scripts, and Linux BASH scripts, for automatic image conversion. Since the BASH scripts do not require version 4, they should also work on OSX (not tested).</p>
<p>The scripts are meant to ensure that your use of images complies with commercial printing standards. In particular, they provide a method for converting color cover artwork to CMYK at 240% ink limit, in a PDF/X-1a:2001 file.</p>
<p>Complete usage instructions are documented within the zip archive.</p>
