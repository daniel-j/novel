<h2>The House on the Borderland - demonstration files</h2>

<h3>Text Block</h3>

<p>The file "borderland.tex" and files in its accompanying folder "borderland-components" are a demonstration of the <i>novel</i> document class for LuaLaTeX.</p>

<p>The files use UNIX-type line endings, so if you are viewing them on Windows, you need a compatible text editor (not Windows Notepad).</p>

<p>File "borderland.pdf" is the compiled result, as PDF/X-1a:2001 and US Web Coated SWOP v2 profile (not embedded). This is with the dimensions and layout of the as-distributed files, resulting in 124 pages, 5.5"x8.5".</p>

<p>Note that this text is not the complete novel. Portions have been omitted, and others edited. Thus, it is not an authoritative edition.</p>

<h3>Cover Artwork</h3>

<p>File "borderland-cover.png" is dimensioned to fit the text block for a Perfect-Print softcover, at the as-distributed dimensions and layout.</p>

<p>According to one widely-used American P.O.D. service, 0.0025" spine width is required per book page, using creme paper. With 124 pages (62 leaves) and 0.0025" per page (0.005" per leaf), the spine must be 0.31" wide. The same service requires bleed of 0.125" at all four edges.</p>

<p>The resulting cover image must be 11.56" wide, 8.75" high. At 300pdi, it is 3468 x 2625 pixels.</p>

<p>The RGB png image can be converted to CMYK jpg, using SWOP color profile at 240% ink limit, according to the instructions in the <i>novel</i> class documentation. You will need the <i>srgb.icc</i> and <i>240.icc</i> color profiles. Then the converted image can be converted to PDF/X-1a:2001 with the US Web Coated SWOP v2 profile (not embedded), using <i>borderland-cover.tex</i>. The result is file borderland-cover.pdf.</p>

<h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>

<p>The files and instructions are offered AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. Use only at your own risk. In particular, the creator of these files does not intend that they be used for printing an actual book.</p>
