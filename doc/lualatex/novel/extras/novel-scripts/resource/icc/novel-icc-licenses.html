<h3>Licenses for icc files in novel-scripts</h3>

<p>These color profiles have been carefully prepared from reputable data, and are believed to provide reasonable performance when used by amateurs creating cover book artwork for print-on-demand. By the very nature of this workflow, the user is not expected to have high-end calibrated equipment or software, and the printer is not expected to produce standard production runs. No attempt has been made to achieve critical accuracy. Therefore, these files are freely distributed WITHOUT WARRANTY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. USE ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
