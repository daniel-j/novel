LuaLaTeX document class for fiction, such as novels and short story collections.


## News

January 14, 2018: Version 1.46.2, now at CTAN and available via TeX package managers, is stable.



### What's Here

Folders *doc*, *tex*, and *fonts* contain development versions of code that may subsequently be available in an updated version of the package.

The *archive* folder contains one or more zip files of prior stable code. This may be useful if you are in the middle of a project, and a package update causes problems.

The *other* folder may contain material that is not part of the TeX package, but might be useful. In particular, it contains a complete novel, with cover artwork, as source and PDF.
